<ul>
<li>The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is a non-profit trade association which issues professional certifications for the information technology industry.  The A+ is one of the first of these certifications, and is intended to encompass the practical and useful information that anyone working in the IT industry should know.</li>

<h3 id="org2145713">Parts of the A+</h3>
<ul>
<li>The A+ is in two parts: 1001 and 1002.  Each test is 90 minutes long and they can be taken the same day or on different days - most people take them separately so that they can prepare for each test on its own terms.  Here is the approximate breakdown of material covered on the A+ 1001:</li>

Both exams will consist of a mixture of traditional multiple choice questions and a differently-formatted type of exercises called Performance Based Questions (PBQs).  We will prepare you for both types of questions.  The following notes are organized based on the exact areas in which CompTIA expects you to have knowledge.

<li>In general, the features that make laptops so useful and desirable - small size, light weight, ability to operate free of wired environments - can combine to make these devices more difficult, overall, to repair.</li>

<li>To occupy the least volume in the case of the laptop, components are often specially designed, interlocked tightly with each other, and in some cases, covered with glue or epoxy.</li>

is important to remember, before repairing <b>any</b> electronic device, that the device is powered off and its power cable removed.  
</p>
<ul>
<li>In most situations it will be important to use anti-static precautions such as an anti-static band or mat (pictured).  This will wick away some of your own electric charge and prevent that charge from damaging components of the device.</li>

<li>Some users do not understand the nature of the function keys and may activate them without realizing.  An important thing to check, for example, if a computer&rsquo;s wireless connection does not seem to be working, is whether it might have been inadvertantly turned off by the user.</li>
<li><b>Backlight</b> - many keyboards are backlit with small LEDs to enable their use in the dark or in dim light.  This feature is usually controleld by a function key or in the device preferences through the operating system.</li>

<li>Laptop keyboards can be replaced, but due to the fact that they are often tightly integrated in the frame of a laptop this is often difficult or expensive.

<ul>
<li>Two components: traditional, magnetic hard drive and an SSD.</li>
<li>In hybrid drives, the SSD component serves as a cache for the magnetic component, allowing for faster drives.  These will be cheaper than 100% SSDs but have some of the disadvantages of mechanical drives: weight, power use, vulnerable to kinetic energy</li>

<h4 id="org3d5cd6b">Hard drive fragmenting / defragmenting</h4>
<ul>
<li>We will discuss this more when we discuss memory devices in excruciating detail later on.  But, briefly, due to the mechanical nature of information retrieval in an HDD, information can be scattered across its diferent platters.  This information will get increasingly physically scattered as the hard drive is used, and can lead to longer and longer retrieval times as the stylus must travel further to seek out and retrieve information.</li>

</ul>
<div class="slide-footer"><br></div>
</section>
<section>
<ul>
<li>This problem can be solved through a process called &ldquo;defragmentation&rdquo; which gets tells the hard drive to reorganize itself so that related information is geographically related as well.  Defragmentation can take time and can produce further wear on the drive but at the end of the process the drive will be a bit snappier.</li>

<li>This is <b>not</b> needed in SSDs - since every piece of the information on an SSD takes the same amount of time to be retrieved, defragmenting these drives will make no difference.</li>

<p>
In most cases, the video card (or, the portion of the hardware that handles the translation and display of video signals) is built into the CPU.  This is, again, due to the space that this saves.  However, this also means that laptops will <b>usually</b> have a less robust ability to display mathematically complex graphics and may struggle with some intensive graphical and video applications.

<h3 id="orgd2a1a64">DC jack</h3>
<ul>
<li>Laptop computers need to convert alternating current (AC) from household electrical sockets to direct current (DC) for the use of most of its internal components.  In most latpops, this conversion happens inside the &ldquo;power brick&rdquo; that we have to lug around.</li>

<li>The power conversion unit (&ldquo;brick&rdquo;) is designed for particular voltages, or may have a switch on it to convert between 110 volts and 220 volts (the most common global voltage values).  Some power adapters can switch between voltage schemes automatically, but others cannot.</li>

<li>The plug that connects an external power supply to the computer is known as the &ldquo;DC jack.&rdquo;  In many cases the plug size and type is unique to a particular computer, and this must be checked carefully if a user is getting a new or repaired power supply.  The attached picture shows a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; power brick and the wide variety of different attachments it needs to be able to attach to different laptops.</li>

<li>There is a slow movement to standardize DC jacks; for example, all new Apple Macintosh laptops now use USB-C type connections rather than the older, more unique power cords.</li>

<li>This also means that different features are integrated into the CPU that might be separated in a desktop computer.  
<ul>
<li>For example, memory and video controllers might be integrated into a CPU designed for a laptop, whereas in a desktop they might be different system cards.</li>

<li>An example: IP68.  First digit deals with dust, second with water
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;6&rdquo; means the device is dust tight.  The second digit &ldquo;8&rdquo; means that the device can be immersed in water up to and beyond 1 meter, generally for 30 minutes</li>
