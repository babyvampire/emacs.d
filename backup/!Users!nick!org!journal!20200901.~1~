Tonight Frankie said that I made her feel "protected."  That when she thought of me she felt safe and OK.  It felt like the nicest thing that anyone had ever said to me, and coming from Frankie made it sweet and heartbreaking.  In seconds I had started to question it, thinking "Does she understand what she is saying?  She's four, for heaven's sake."  

That's a silly way for me to think, and unnecessary.  It would be nice if I could learn to accept compliments and nice things from my own daughter at least.  

Thinking it over, I can't imagine wanting Frankie to feel any other way about me.  And I have felt like that was my job, to help her feel that way, from the very moment I first held her, from the first time I dribbled those tiny drops of formula down her throat and felt her swallow them, right up until this very slice of time right now.
