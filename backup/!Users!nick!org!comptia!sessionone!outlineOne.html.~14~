<ul>
<li>The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is a non-profit trade association which issues professional certifications for the information technology industry.  The A+ is one of the first of these certifications, and is intended to encompass the practical and useful information that anyone working in the IT industry should know.</li>

<h3 id="org623d961">Parts of the A+</h3>
<ul>
<li>The A+ is in two parts: 1001 and 1002.  Each test is 90 minutes long and they can be taken the same day or on different days - most people take them separately so that they can prepare for each test on its own terms.  Here is the approximate breakdown of material covered on the A+ 1001:</li>

<li>Some users do not understand the nature of the function keys and may activate them without realizing.  An important thing to check, for example, if a computer&rsquo;s wireless connection does not seem to be working, is whether it might have been inadvertantly turned off by the user.</li>
<li><b>Backlight</b> - many keyboards are backlit with small LEDs to enable their use in the dark or in dim light.  This feature is usually controleld by a function key or in the device preferences through the operating system.</li>

<h4 id="org63aac26">Hard drive fragmenting / defragmenting</h4>
<ul>
<li>We will discuss this more when we discuss memory devices in excruciating detail later on.  But, briefly, due to the mechanical nature of information retrieval in an HDD, information can be scattered across its diferent platters.  This information will get increasingly physically scattered as the hard drive is used, and can lead to longer and longer retrieval times as the stylus must travel further to seek out and retrieve information.</li>

</ul>
<div class="slide-footer"><br></div>
</section>
<section>
<ul>
<li>This problem can be solved through a process called &ldquo;defragmentation&rdquo; which gets tells the hard drive to reorganize itself so that related information is geographically related as well.  Defragmentation can take time and can produce further wear on the drive but at the end of the process the drive will be a bit snappier.</li>

<li>This is <b>not</b> needed in SSDs - since every piece of the information on an SSD takes the same amount of time to be retrieved, defragmenting these drives will make no difference.</li>

<h3 id="org0aa6c0a">Video card</h3>
<p>
In most cases, the video card (or, the portion of the hardware that handles the translation and display of video signals) is built into the CPU.  This is, again, due to the space that this saves.  However, this also means that laptops will <b>usually</b> have a less robust ability to display mathematically complex graphics and may struggle with some intensive graphical and video applications.
</p>

<p>
Video cards on laptops are usually not upgradable.

<div class="slide-footer"><br></div>
</section>
<section id="slide-org4bc25e0">
<h3 id="org4bc25e0">DC jack</h3>
<p>
Laptop computers need to convert alternating current (AC) from household electrical sockets to direct current (DC) for the use of most of its internal components.  In most latpops, this conversion happens inside the &ldquo;power brick&rdquo; that we have to lug around.
</p>

<p>
The power conversion unit (&ldquo;brick&rdquo;) is designed for particular voltages, or may have a switch on it to convert between 110 volts and 220 volts (the most common global voltage values).  Some power adapters can switch between voltage schemes automatically, but others cannot.
</p>

<p>
The plug that connects an external power supply to the computer is known as the &ldquo;DC jack.&rdquo;  In many cases the plug size and type is unique to a particular computer, and this must be checked carefully if a user is getting a new or repaired power supply.  The attached picture shows a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; power brick and the wide variety of different attachments it needs to be able to attach to different laptops.
</p>

<p>
There is a slow movement to standardize DC jacks; for example, all new Apple Macintosh laptops now use USB-C type connections rather than the older, more unique power cords.

<h3 id="org7a3a4ec">Touchpad</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Touchpads</b>  Most laptops now have touchpads for direct interactionnavigating with a graphical user environment, taking the place of an external mouse.  Touchpads can be enabled and disabled through system preferences, at times through a keyboard function key, and are prone to their own set of dysfunctions.  Touchpads can become dirty, unplugged from the central components, or inadvertantly touched and activated by users.</li>

<section id="slide-orgfd01cb7">
<h3 id="orgfd01cb7">Plastics/frames – Speaker</h3>
<p>
Sound from laptops are generated by internal speakers.  A number of things can go wrong with these, including being physically disconnected from the control units of the computer, to being inadvertantly turned off by the user.  Speakers are also more vulnerable to damage by liquid and dust.
</p>

<p>
Laptop frames are generally made out of plastic to reduce weight and decrease cost.  Some laptops include both plastic and metal components in their frame to increase durability.

<section id="slide-org53f1213">
<h3 id="org53f1213">System board</h3>
<p>
&ldquo;System board&rdquo; is a term that designates the matrix that connects all the most important components of a computer.  Modules such as the CPU, RAM, and power management are usually found on the system board.  Unlike desktop computers, in which there are a number of standard system board types and sizes, most system boards are custom designed for each model of laptop to meet contraints of power and weight.  As such, they are much more difficult to repair than their desktop cousins.

<div class="slide-footer"><br></div>
</section>
<section id="slide-org08aaef6">
<h3 id="org08aaef6">CPU</h3>
<p>
As with other components of a laptop computer, CPUs for laptops are designed with power consumption in mind.  CPUs for mobile devices are usually smaller, lighter, use less power, and generate less heat than their desktop counterparts.  This also means that different features are integrated into the CPU that might be separated in a desktop computer.  
</p>

<p>
For example, memory and video controllers might be integrated into a CPU designed for a laptop, whereas in a desktop they might be different system cards.
</p>

<p>
This means, as with many other features of laptops, that mobile CPUs are not generally replaceable or upgradeable.  When a component of a system board fails, the quickest and cheapest response is usually to switch out the entire board.

<p>
In backlit LCDs, the lighting is generally provided by a cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) which is powered by an inverter whose task is to convert DC power from the laptop back into AC power (<b>picture</b>).  Both the inverter and / or the CCFL can fail and require replacement. 
</p>

<p>
An important step to test <b>any</b> potentially failing screen is to see if the computer can be connected to an external monitor.  In addition, if only the backlight or inverter has failed on an LCD screen, you should still be able to see images on the screen with the aid of a flashlight.

<li>To prevent misuse and for protection of privacy, Bluetooth devices must be <i>paired</i> with each other and you must approve the pairing on your mobile device.  To connect with another device, you will need to make your device <b>discoverable</b> - these days, the default is for your device to <b>not</b> be discoverable.</li>

The OSI model is not specifically part of the A+ 1001 objectives, but it is a model that you will see throughout your time in IT.  My experience is that having even a vague understanding of this model will help you sort out the nature and purpose of some of the network devices we have just talked about.

<p>
So mostly this is just here for you to look at so that you will recognize the terms later.
