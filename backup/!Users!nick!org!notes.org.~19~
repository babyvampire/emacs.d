** Cover sentence
I am trained as a physician, and I have worked extensively in public mental health.  I have experience working with patients in the community, traveling to their homes for in-person interviews and care. I have led clinical teams in both inpatient and outpatient settings. I believe that patients should feel that they are partners in their own care.

** Cover letter

Dear Recruiting team at Athena Consulting,

My name is Nicholas Taintor, and I am a physician living in Fairfax, Virginia.  I am writing to express my interest in the position of Case Investigator, with the Commonwealth of Virginia COVID-19 contact tracing effort.  I found notification of this position through the VDH website.

I believe that my medical and personal background makes me a strong candidate for this position.  I have spent my career learning how to conduct diagnostic and therapeutic interviews in a way that is empathic, sensitive, and mindful of confidentiality.  I understood early in my training that without a person's trust, there was little chance that they would follow my suggestions, no matter how correct or well-meant they might be.

I have a strong interest in medical informatics and have worked with a number of different electronic health record systems. I have contributed code and knowledge to a program helping to promote the use of the Veterans Administration electronic health record (VistA / CPRS) around the world.  These skills will help me document and present all of my interactions with, and findings from, persons believed to be infected with COVID-19.

In my view, the best kind of medicine and care happen when colleagues work with and learn from each other.  Helping to put a team together and learning how to work as a cohesive unit has always been my favorite part of any new job, and I look forward to being able to practice those skills. 

Although my residency training was in psychiatry, at New York University we were granted some leeway in our training.  Unlike most of my psychiatric colleagues, I asked for clinical rotations in medicine, infectious diseases, and oncology.  I spent three months working in the ICU at Bellevue Hospital helping to treat patients in advanced phases of illness.  I was the primary physician for a patient with one of the first locally-acquired cases of fulminant malaria seen in New York for years, and worked with epidemiologists to clarify the origins of that case. 

I have spent much of my medical career working in public health, and usually with people who are underserved by existing medical systems.  Learning how to earn the trust and partnership of people who might have a natural and understandable mistrust of medicine and authority is not easy or simple.  But it is the most important part of the process.

I trained at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, which is (in my view) the most vital public health institution in that city.  This is a place where people come when they do not have health insurance and often lack many other types of social support.  I learned from the best, there, about how to bring people in from the community and help them realize the ways in which they could get better.  I worked in the Free Clinic at Bellevue during medical school and residency and began to understand how to work with a diverse community of people who were very different from me.

Helping people to change their behavior is the basis of any worthwhile medical intervention.  Sometimes this is something simple, such as getting people to stop doing something that is hurting them such as smoking or excessive alcohol consumption.  At other times this is more complex - getting people to do something difficult and unpleasant with an unclear and distant payoff.  

During this COVID-19 pandemic, and as part of the contact tracing program, we will be asking people to isolate or quarantine themselves for the good of others.  This will require ongoing care and relationship-building with people who will be in a difficult and frightening situation - in a crisis, to put it simply.  I believe that my previous experience, along with my desire and willingness to learn more, will make me a valuable part of this program.

I will be ready to put my skills to work for the Commonwealth of Virginia, and more importantly to learn how I can contribute best to the effort.  I look forward to being a part of this important project.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to look through my application materials.

** Audio:
- Here's a way to change the audio config at the beginning:
#+begin_src 
# Set autoplay to true for audio plugin.
#+OER_REVEAL_AUDIO_SLIDESHOW_CONFIG: audioStartAtFragment: true, audio: { advance: -1, autoplay: true, defaultDuration: 0, defaultAudios: false, playerOpacity: 0.8, playerStyle: 'position: fixed; bottom: 9.5vh; left: 0%; width: 30%; height:30px; z-index: 33;' }

#+end_src

** Incorporating license data
**** Trying to figure out a way to:
Extract and put in license information in image metadata
   - Exiftool - FOSS, mac & Linux
   - mac CLI: [[https://exiftool.org/][exiftool]] - FOSS. =Brew install exiftool=
   - Ubuntu: =sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl=
   - Here's an example of how to put information into an image using =exiftool=:
#+begin_src bash
exiftool -ImageDescription="This is an image from the book Frankiesaurus and the Helpful Spider" -Artist="Nick Taintor" \

#+end_src
**** Here's a package that could be useful:
[[https://github.com/emacsmirror/exiftool][exiftool.el]] is an elisp wrapper around ExifTool

**** emacs-reveal .meta file components:
example: 
((filename . "./figures/data-structures/block-chain.png")

)



3) develop a workflow to put that information into an emacs-reveal .meta file

* CompTIA class site
- <2020-07-11 Sat> temporarily running it under frankie.monster, having some weird issues with my pepsidotcom.com url  **resolved**
- <2020-07-16 Thu> now living at *index.org* in *sessionone* directory, straight export to HTML
- 
* Matrix/Jitsi
** sources for build:
- using mostly [[https://dev.to/joenas/matrix-homeserver-synapse-v09911-with-traefik-35ja][Jon Neverland's build]], but his model was built with Traefik 1.0
- Also, I put all the various accompanying directories right off ~/docker/containers/matrix rather than off /opt/matrix the way he did
- will install ma1sd identity server from its [[https://github.com/ma1uta/ma1sd][Github repo]]
  - (but will do it later - will probably need to add m.identity_server in ./matrix/nginx/www/.well-known/matrix/client)
** trying a thing <2020-07-27 Mon>
- Trouble (seems) to be with videobridge.  When I exec'd into the container yesterday, ~/etc/init.d/jitsi-videobridge2 status~ returned FAIL
- I could restart it manually within the container, but what's the point?
- Followed various Github issues, including [[https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet/issues/573][this one]], but my issue still not resolved
- So I decided I would build the whole thing on metal on Dudley so that I can compare things.
- Using [[https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/06/running-your-own-secure-communication-service-with-matrix-and-jitsi][this]] off the main matrix site, following their Debian instXFallation guide
- following instructions [[https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/postgres.md][here]] to change synapse database to postgres
- seemed to work; had to put server_name in homeserver.yaml
** Back to trying Jitsi with Docker
- <2020-07-30 Thu> Based on [[https://community.jitsi.org/t/traefik-and-docker-install/23551/42][this jitsi.org thread]] (last post May 27th) a fundamental problem is getting jvb to work over UDP with Traefik
  - But keep looking at that thread and successors
** So the question that goes through my mind now is:
- can we figure out a way to have matrix / jitsi baremetal and traefik live together?

* Setting up Hetzner server
** [[https://robot.your-server.de/server][Robot address]]
** SSD and HDD
Eventually figured out how to put OS on SSD.  On first =installimage= comment out all drives but SSD, change SSD name to =DISK1=
*** However,
- doesn't boot right. What I would like is to have the OS boot off of the SSD. I want the HDDs to just be file storage.  Working from [[https://hostedtalk.net/t/hetzner-setting-additional-ssd-as-boot/1865/13][this]] discussion, started over.
- The issue with my server is that the SSD is locared at sdc instead of sda, so you gotta do all kinds of tricky things to tget it to boot first.  Which are detailed here:
*** remove all partitions using =parted=
- all you need to do is make a new partition table, and everything prior is erased
*** using =installimage=, commented out HDDs and changed SSD name to DISK1
- so, installed ubuntu to SSD
- (changed SWRAID to 0)
*** first steps:
- create a small (~10MB) partition on each 3TB disk, type set to bios boot:
  - using =gdisk=:
    - for bios-boot partition
      - =<n>= - new partition
      - =<enter>= - first available sector
      - =+10M= - 10MiB in size
      - type: =ef02= - bios boot
    - for rest
      - =<n>= - new partition
      - =<enter>= - first available sector
      - =-0= - to end
      - type: =8300= - linux file system
  - =w= to write and quit when done
*** then, root partition appears to be =/dev/sdc3=
- boot partition appears to be =/dev/sdc2/=
- so:
  1. =mount /dev/sdc3 /mnt=
  2. =mount /dev/sdc2 /mnt/boot=
- this way both root and boot partitions are mounted
*** bind mount dev/proc/sys into root-partition
- =for f in proc sys dev ; do mount --bind /$f /mnt/$f ; done=
- =chroot /mnt /bin/bash=
- =grub-install /dev/sda=
- =grub-install /dev/sdb=
- =update-grub=
- =reboot=
*** Holy shit that worked!
*** However, still no file system
- In both fdisk and gdisk, partitions are made without file systems, so
  - =mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2= for example
  - This worked for both of them
*** Setting up mount points and fstab:
- mounted sda2 at /mnt/driveA, sdb2 at /mnt/driveB
- made a =data= group to own them
- =sudo usermod -aG data USERNAME= to add users to the group
- used =chmod g+s .;= to (hopefully) sets the group id (setgid) on the current directory, which should mean that new files will inherit the ownership - even if copied (but not if moved)
** Setting up mergerFS
*** github repo [[https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs][here]]
- since we're using Jellyfin, need to set the attribute =func.getattr=newest= so that Jellyfin does not get confused when it is looking through directories for updates
- here is the string I will use: 
=mergerfs -o defaults,allow_other,use_ino,func.getattr=newest,cache.files=partial,dropcacheonclose=true,category.create=mfs,fsname=mergerFS /mnt/disk\* /mnt/pool=
*** needs =sudo=
- I screwed up the first time and forgot to sudo it, ended up with an inaccessible directory with lots of quations marks on =ls=
- =fusemount -u <directory>= fixed this, then I could remount it
- permissions are a problem - also had the above issue when I tried to mount it with =sudo= but the permissions on the mount point were =nick:staff=

* Helping with mom's computer
** <2020-09-07 Mon> Fixed:
- Showed her how to put bookmarks in bookmarks bar, worked on those
- Cleaned up notification bar pinned apps
- Now, the Vhrome that is pinned there will open up signed into her account (or should!)
- Jumbled-looking text on Google Chrome but fine in other browsers (tried Firefox and Edge)
  - tried:
    - Turning on / off hardware acceleration in Google Chrome
    - Turning on / off TrueText
  - worked: For some reason, signing her back into her Google account fixed the problem
- Updated: Still on 1909, 2004 update not yet available and per people in Reddit worth skipping
  - Allowed Windows Update to do its thing, there were things that it was updating within 1909
  - Waiting to see how that worked
- Pending: For some reason, her desktop is not the nice blank slate I would want it to be - it's almost like some of the start button options are always on top.  Also her wallpaper keeps disappearing (though that might have to do with me signing in with TeamViewer)
* Setting up advance directives in Virginia
** Starting:
- A good place to start is the American Bar Association's Tool Kit for Health Care Advance Planning (found [[https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_aging/resources/health_care_decision_making/consumer_s_toolkit_for_health_care_advance_planning/][here]]).  This walks you through some of the steps you need to think through when you are starting down this road.
- Once you've looked that over (or if you already think you know what you are doing!), the best place to get started with the specifics starts on the Virginia State Bar's page on healthcare decision-making (which is [[https://www.vsb.org/site/public/healthcare-decisions-day][here]]).
  - The above page has links to the current forms you need to fill out, in PDF form (and with the fields set up in the PDF, so easier to fill out on your computer).
  - It also has a link to the [[https://connectvirginia.org/adr][Virginia Advance Health Care Directives Registry]] (VAHCDR) which is where you are able to securely store your directive forms.
    - Once you have created an account on the VAHDCR and stored your documents there, you can print out a wallet card to carry with you, which will allow people to access the VAHDCR and look up your stuff.
