Tonight Frankie said that I made her feel "protected."  That when she thought of me she felt safe and OK.  It felt like the nicest thing that anyone had ever said to me, and coming from Frankie made it sweet and heartbreaking.  In seconds I had started to question it, thinking "Does she understand what she is saying?  She's four, for heaven's sake."  

That's a silly way for me to think, and unnecessary.  It would be nice if I could learn to accept compliments and nice things from my own daughter at least.  

Thinking it over, I can't imagine wanting Frankie to feel any other way about me.  And I have felt like that was my job, to help her feel that way, from the very moment I first held her, from the first time I dribbled those tiny drops of formula down her throat and felt her swallow them, right up until this very slice of time right now.

But the other and slightly more depressing and agonizing thing is that: I love her so much, and I am not doing enough to even be able to see her again, let alone spend time with her.  I've got to focus.

Reading a book to her could work - could extract images from the file I have for the Sneetches, mount them in emacs-reveal.  Have not fully examined the thing in reveal.js where other people can link to your presenation on their machines in a live session.  That could work, right?  Me talking on a phone and her looking at the book on the computer.  It will never be the same as a physical book and sitting with her.  But it will be something.  Maybe a combo of jitsi and emacs-reveal?  

I need sleep so badly.

Last cigarette was early Thursday morning, around 2am.  It's been strange, and there are definitely some analogies to quitting drinking, at least in a neurochemical sense.  Reality has seemed a little less trustworthy, and some feelings seem slightly new and unrecognizable. But overall good!  I have to keep reminding myself of the things that Allen Carr says - every bit of irritability, every bit of withdrawal, celebrate it because it is the poison leaving my body and the beginning of a new freedom.

I came close last night, and with the usual triggers that I remember from the second-to-last time I quit (the last time I quit being in jail) - being pissed off at other people, and letting my addiction use that as an excuse for a relapse.  It was often Laura, back then.  Last night it was my mom being strange about the issues sending me text messages from her iPhone to my android phone, and for a while every word of hers seemed triggering.

I was just about to get into some serious complaining about other people, but that's no good, right?  I miss Frankie and I wish she was here.  Me feeling irritated at others is as usual a way to avoid feelings of sadness and inadequacy.

I will apply for more jobs tomorrow.  It was good spending time with Chris.  I really need ot get a sponsor.
