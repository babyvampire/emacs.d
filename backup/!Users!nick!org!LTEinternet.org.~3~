* Basic steps:
1. Set up the device you will be using to communicate with the LTE modem
2. Set up your LTE modem
3. Set up the device you will be using as a router for your LTE modem
* Set up your Raspberry Pi

** Raspberry Pi 3B+

*** Set up SD card

**** command line

**** Raspberry Pi imager

*** connect to Pi

**** can do directly from mac:
- connect ethernet cable from mac to Pi
- =ping raspberrypi.local= will usually give you the IP address
- it will likely have given itself an IP address in the 169.254.0.1 rage using APIPA because it could not find a DHCP server
- set up Internet Sharing
  - System Preferences --> Sharing
  - check "Internet Sharing" box
  - then check the box of the connection (in my case USB 10/100/1000 LAN)
- ping =raspberrypi.local= again to find its IP address, has probably been set up in the 192.168.2.x range
- or, can just =ssh pi@raspberrypi.local=

*** set up Pi:
**** set up new user
- =sudo adduser nick=
- get =groups= from user =pi=
- add nick to same groups as pi:
  - =usermod -a -G group1,group2,group3,[etc] nick=
  - sudo usermod -a -G pi,adm,dialout,cdrom,sudo,audio,video,plugdev,games,users,input,netdev,gpio,i2c,spi nick
- check to make sure =nick= is part of =sudo=
- erase user =pi= and their directories etc:
  - =# deluser --remove-home pi=
**** Config stuff
- =sudo raspi-config=
- change =hostname=
- under =Localisation Options=, =Change Locale= and add =en-us.UTF-8=
  - then select it as default locale
- change timezone under =Localisation Options=
- update raspi-config
- update Pi
**** Use Pi to work on modem
***** this time, using Sierra Wireless MC7354 - U.FL connectors on modem
****** get the firmware
- link to Sierra Wireless page with MC7354 firmware: [[https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airprime/software/airprime-em73xx_mc73xx-fw-package-latest-release/][here]]
- latest build for this modem is 4837 dated Mar 20, 2019
- downloaded =Build4837-Approved-Only-7354-SPK.zip= at https://source.sierrawireless.com/-/media/support_downloads/airprime/software/minicard/em_mc73xx_fw_build4837/build4837-approved-only-7354-spk.ashx
****** install these packages:
- =sudo apt-get install libqmi-utils minicom libuuid-tiny-perl libipc-shareable-perl snapd bridge-utils libmbim-utils modem-manager=
****** see USB identification
- run =dmesg= after attaching modem enclosure / USB device, should see the new deice being registered along with name
- run =ttyUSB=$(dmesg | grep '.3: Qualcomm USB modem converter detected' -A1 | grep -Eo 'ttyUSB[0-9]$' | tail -1)= which will assign =$ttyUSB= to modem
  - =echo $ttyUSB= to check
  - in this case is =ttyUSB2=
- get =pid= and =vid= from =lsusb=
****** copy the spk file to the Pi
****** then run this to update firmware:
#+begin_src bash
sudo qmi-firmware-update \
     --update \
     -d 1199:68c0 \
9999999_9902574_SWI9X15C_05.05.58.00_00_GENNA-UMTS_005.025_002-field.spk
#+end_src
- (GENNA-UMTS is the generic carrier firmware)
- (also turns out that by using this version of =qmi-firmware-update= we don't have to use the whole =swi_setusbcomp.pl= thing anymore, because it is incorporated within =qmi-firmware-update= -- maybe??)
****** communicating with the modem
******* using minicom
- =minicom -o -D /dev/ttyUSB2 -b 9600=
******* AT commands
- some AT commands are different on the MC7354, there's a good compendium of all the AT commands for this modem [[https://poohyhoh.blogspot.com/2017/06/lte-mc7354-at-command-test.html][here]].
  #+begin_src bash
AT should return OK
(if AT returns nothing, try
ATE which should echo things to console    
AT!ENTERCND="A710"     allows entering advanced commands
AT!SELACQ     select RAT acquisition order
AT!SELACQ=?
AT!SELACQ=LTE     put LTE first in acquisition order
AT!GETRAT?      Return the current active radio access technology (RAT)
at!reset     reset the modem
at!gstatus?      Return operational status


  #+end_src
******* using =mbimcli= - modem needs to be in MBIM mode, ModemManager stopped
******** script in /etc/mbim-network.conf:
#+begin_src bash
APN=fast.t-mobile.com
PROXY=yes
#+end_src
******** then,
- sudo systemctl stop ModemManager
- sudo mbim-network /dev/cdc-wdm0 start    Starts the network connection
- sudo mbim-network /dev/cdc-wdm0 status
- then restart ModemManager
* OpenWrt router
** change IP address
- =nano /etc/config/network=
- change IP address on interface 'lan'
- then =/etc/init.d/network restart=
or
- uci set network.lan.ipaddr='new-ip-address'
- uci set network.lan.gateway='your-gateway-address'
- uci set network.lan.dns='dns-address-here'
- uci commit && service network restart
** Enabling statistics
- opkg update 
- opkg install luci-app-statistics
*** install plugins
- =opkg list | grep collectd-mod=
- =opkg install collectd-mod-cpu collectd-mod-interface collectd-mod-memory collectd-mod-ping collectd-mod-rrdtool collectd-mod-wireless=
*** enable daemons
- =/etc/init.d/luci_statistics enable=
- =/etc/init.d/collectd enable=
