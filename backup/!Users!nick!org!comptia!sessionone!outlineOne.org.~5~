* Introduction to CompTIA A+
** This the A+

- The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is a non-profit trade association which issues professional certifications for the information technology industry.  The A+ is one of the first of these certifications, and is intended to encompass the practical and useful information that anyone working in the IT industry should know.

** Parts of the A+

- The A+ is in two parts: 1001 and 1002.  Each test is 90 minutes long and they can be taken the same day or on different days - most people take them separately so that they can prepare for each test on its own terms.  Here is the approximate breakdown of material covered on the A+ 1001:

** A table

| Domain                                   | Percentage of examination |
|------------------------------------------+---------------------------|
| 1.0 Mobile Devices                       |                       14% |
| 2.0 Networking                           |                       20% |
| 3.0 Hardware                             |                       27% |
| 4.0 Virtualization and Cloud Computing   |                       12% |
| 5.0 Hardware and Network Troubleshooting |                       27% |
|------------------------------------------+---------------------------|

** Types of questions

Both exams will consist of a mixture of traditional multiple choice questions and a differently-formatted type of exercises called Performance Based Questions (PBQs).  We will prepare you for both types of questions.  The following notes are organized based on the exact areas in which CompTIA expects you to have knowledge.

* 1.1 – Given a scenario, install and configure laptop hardware and components.

** Hardware/device replacement
In general, the features that make laptops so useful and desirable - small size, light weight, ability to operate free of wired environments - can combine to make these devices more difficult, overall, to repair.  To occupy the least volume in the case of the laptop, components are often specially designed, interlocked tightly with each other, and in some cases, covered with glue or epoxy.

** That said,  
- individual components of laptops can be repaired under the right circumstances 
- Many laptops have a modular design that eases the removal and replacement of different parts.  This is particularly true of random access memory (RAM) and hard drives.  

- But a number of laptops will not be able to have anything upgraded or repaired by the user.

** Precautions when repairing a laptop 
is important to remember, before repairing *any* electronic device, that the device is powered off and its power cable removed.  In most situations it will be important to use anti-static precautions such as an anti-static band or mat (pictured).  This will wick away some of your own electric charge and prevent that charge from damaging components of the device.
** Antistatic pad

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500 :style float:left;
# [[./images/1-1AntiStaticPad.jpeg]]

** Laptop Keyboards
#+ATTR_HTML: :style text-align:left
- Often the number of keys is sacrificed for space and weight
- More function keys and combination keys than seen on desktop keyboards
- Smaller than most desktop keyboards

*** Function / special keys

#+caption: Keyboard function keys, activated by pressing the Fn key
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500 :style float:left;
[[file:./images/1-1keyboardFunctionKeys.jpg]]

- Important keys are concealed in the function keys on the average laptop computer
  - including: volume settings, toggling between the internal monitor or an external one, turning on or off the wireless signal, and controlling the brightness of the screen.  These buttons are usually activated by pressing the *Fn* key in combination with them.
  - Some users do not understand the nature of the function keys and may activate them without realizing.  An important thing to check, for example, if a computer's wireless connection does not seem to be working, is whether it might have been inadvertantly turned off by the user.
  - *Backlight* - many keyboards are backlit with small LEDs to enable their use in the dark or in dim light.  This feature is usually controleld by a function key or in the device preferences through the operating system.

*** troubleshooting laptop keyboards
#+caption: laptop keyboard
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.6\textwidth 
[[./images/1-1KeyboardOutline.jpeg]]

- Laptop keyboards can be replaced, but due to the fact that they are often tightly integrated in the frame of a laptop this is often difficult or expensive.  A non- or poorly functioning keyboard can be due to dust or dirt accumulating under the keys, or a broken or twisted data cable under the keyboard.

** Hard drives
*** SSD vs. hybrid vs. magnetic disk
#+ATTR_HTML: :float t :style text-align:left
- We will discuss this further in Storage Devices, but briefly:
  + Magnetic disks (HDD = Hard Disk Drive):
    - Spinning platters with stylus - slow, consumes power, generally larger and heavier
    - Due to their mechanical and more delicate nature can be damaged or disabled by sudden movement

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: a mechanical, magnetic hard drive in all its glory
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.8\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[file:./images/1-1-LaptopHDD.jpeg]]

#+REVEAL: split

  + Solid State Drives (SSDs)
    - no moving parts - all flash memory
    - silent, faster than HDD, lighter, more durable, uses less power - all ideal features for laptops
    - more expensive than HDDs, but their price is gradually decreasing
    - 1.8 inch and 2.5 inch form factors
#+REVEAL: split
  + Hybrid drive (SSHD)
    - Two components: traditional, magnetic hard drive and an SSD.
    - In hybrid drives, the SSD component serves as a cache for the magnetic component, allowing for faster drives.  These will be cheaper than 100% SSDs but have some of the disadvantages of mechanical drives: weight, power use, vulnerable to kinetic energy

[[file:./images/1-1-HDD-SSD.jpeg]]

*** 1.8in vs. 2.5in
#+ATTR_HTML: :style text-align:left
- *HDDs* in laptops typically 2.5in
- *SSDs* can be 1.8 or 2.5 in

#+CAPTION: Side-by-side comparison of 1.8in and 2.5in SSDs and HDD

[[file:./images/1-1-18+25Drives.png]]

*** Hard drive fragmenting / defragmenting
- We will discuss this more when we discuss memory devices in excruciating detail later on.  But, briefly, due to the mechanical nature of information retrieval in an HDD, information can be scattered across its diferent platters.  This information will get increasingly physically scattered as the hard drive is used, and can lead to longer and longer retrieval times as the stylus must travel further to seek out and retrieve information.  
#+REVEAL: split
- This problem can be solved through a process called "defragmentation" which gets tells the hard drive to reorganize itself so that related information is geographically related as well.  Defragmentation can take time and can produce further wear on the drive but at the end of the process the drive will be a bit snappier.

- This is *not* needed in SSDs - since every piece of the information on an SSD takes the same amount of time to be retrieved, defragmenting these drives will make no difference.

** Memory
#+ATTR_HTML: :style text-align:left
- Laptops use smaller memory modules than desktop machines:
#+ATTR_HTML: :style text-align:left
- Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module (SODIMM):
#+ATTR_HTML: :style text-align:center
| Memory Type | Module Format |
|-------------+---------------|
| DDR         | 200-pin       |
| DDR2        | 200-pin       |
| DDR3        | 204-pin       |
| DDR4        | 260-pin       |
|-------------+---------------|
- Micro-DIMM: Micro-Dual In-line Memory Module

We will be discussing the particulars of memory at much greater length later on, don't worry!

#+caption: Here's a SODIMM!

[[./images/1-1-SODIMM.jpeg]]


** Portable device storage media
- Different sizes and capacities of storage media for portable devices
- SD (Secure Digital) card:

#+caption: Different sizes of storage cards for portable devices
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.4\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[file:./images/1-1SDcardspng.png]]

** Optical drive

Although this is listed as a CompTIA objective, CD and DVD drives found only in much older laptops.  We will discuss this type of media later in the class.

** Wireless cards and Bluetooth modules
#+ATTR_HTML: :style text-align:left
- Laptops can have a number of wireless communications interfaces, from 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WiFi, near field communications (NFC), and bluetooth.
(we will discuss these a great deal more, presently.)
- These connections are usually controlled by the operating system and can be changed in the system preferences; some laptops will have function buttons on the keyboard to turn wireless signals on or off.

** Cellular card
- Increasingly, laptops have the option to enable a separate cellular data communication.  This is of a type different from more conventional WiFi, but still using radio signals of different frequencies.  This service is handled on the backend by the user's cellular provider.
** Video card
In most cases, the video card (or, the portion of the hardware that handles the translation and display of video signals) is built into the CPU.  This is, again, due to the space that this saves.  However, this also means that laptops will *usually* have a less robust ability to display mathematically complex graphics and may struggle with some intensive graphical and video applications.

Video cards on laptops are usually not upgradable.  
** DC jack
Laptop computers need to convert alternating current (AC) from household electrical sockets to direct current (DC) for the use of most of its internal components.  In most latpops, this conversion happens inside the "power brick" that we have to lug around.

The power conversion unit ("brick") is designed for particular voltages, or may have a switch on it to convert between 110 volts and 220 volts (the most common global voltage values).  Some power adapters can switch between voltage schemes automatically, but others cannot.

The plug that connects an external power supply to the computer is known as the "DC jack."  In many cases the plug size and type is unique to a particular computer, and this must be checked carefully if a user is getting a new or repaired power supply.  The attached picture shows a "universal" power brick and the wide variety of different attachments it needs to be able to attach to different laptops.

There is a slow movement to standardize DC jacks; for example, all new Apple Macintosh laptops now use USB-C type connections rather than the older, more unique power cords.

#+caption:A universal laptop power supply
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.4\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[./images/1-1-DCjacks2.jpeg]]


** Battery

#+caption: Some batteries
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.8\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[./images/1-1ManyBatteries.jpeg]]

Most laptop batteries are lithium ion (Li-ion).  With time and repeated charges, the battery's ability to hold and maintain charge will diminish.

** Touchpad
- *Touchpads*  Most laptops now have touchpads for direct interactionnavigating with a graphical user environment, taking the place of an external mouse.  Touchpads can be enabled and disabled through system preferences, at times through a keyboard function key, and are prone to their own set of dysfunctions.  Touchpads can become dirty, unplugged from the central components, or inadvertantly touched and activated by users.
** Plastics/frames – Speaker
Sound from laptops are generated by internal speakers.  A number of things can go wrong with these, including being physically disconnected from the control units of the computer, to being inadvertantly turned off by the user.  Speakers are also more vulnerable to damage by liquid and dust.

Laptop frames are generally made out of plastic to reduce weight and decrease cost.  Some laptops include both plastic and metal components in their frame to increase durability.

** System board
"System board" is a term that designates the matrix that connects all the most important components of a computer.  Modules such as the CPU, RAM, and power management are usually found on the system board.  Unlike desktop computers, in which there are a number of standard system board types and sizes, most system boards are custom designed for each model of laptop to meet contraints of power and weight.  As such, they are much more difficult to repair than their desktop cousins.  
** CPU
As with other components of a laptop computer, CPUs for laptops are designed with power consumption in mind.  CPUs for mobile devices are usually smaller, lighter, use less power, and generate less heat than their desktop counterparts.  This also means that different features are integrated into the CPU that might be separated in a desktop computer.  

For example, memory and video controllers might be integrated into a CPU designed for a laptop, whereas in a desktop they might be different system cards.

This means, as with many other features of laptops, that mobile CPUs are not generally replaceable or upgradeable.  When a component of a system board fails, the quickest and cheapest response is usually to switch out the entire board.

* 1.2 – Given a scenario, install components within the display of a laptop.

** Types
*** *LCD*   
Liquid Crystal Display.  In these displays, light shines through a sheet of liquid crystal which changes shape with varying electrical current.  The liquid crystal itself provides no illumination and must be backlit.

#+caption: inside an LCD
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.8\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[./images/1-2-LCDpanel.jpg]]

In backlit LCDs, the lighting is generally provided by a cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) which is powered by an inverter whose task is to convert DC power from the laptop back into AC power (*picture*).  Both the inverter and / or the CCFL can fail and require replacement. 

#+caption: an inverter and a CCFL
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.8\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[./images/1-2-InverterCCFL.jpeg]]

An important step to test *any* potentially failing screen is to see if the computer can be connected to an external monitor.  In addition, if only the backlight or inverter has failed on an LCD screen, you should still be able to see images on the screen with the aid of a flashlight.

*** OLED
Organic Light Emitting Diode - no backlight required, organic diodes emit light in response to electrical current.  The organic compiunds can be "printed" on almost any subtrate.  These screens are usually thinnner and lighter than LCDs, but use more power.  

#+caption: LCD and OLED panels
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[./images/1-2-LCD-OLED.jpeg]]
** WiFi antenna connector/placement
Laptops can have a number of different antennae, including WiFi, Bluetooth, and cellular.

WiFi cards have some different form and size factors, and most usually their antennae wrap around the display of the device.

#+caption: An M.2 WiFi card

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.5\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[./images/1-1-PCIeWiFi.jpeg]]

** Webcam
Webcams are usually located in the frame of the display.  Care must be taken to not damage them when the display is being repaired.  Cameras are generally controlled by the operating system.
** Microphone
Microphones can be located anywhere on the frame of the laptop and are not always prominant.
** Digitizer/touchscreen

Some laptops or tablets will have digitizers as part of their displays, allowing them to be used as touchscreens.  Anything which can damage the display can damage the touchscreen.  
* 1.3 – Given a scenario, use appropriate laptop features.

** Docking station
A docking station allows the user to connect their laptop to an external keyboard, display, mouse, and external video cards
** Port replicator
A port replicator is similar to a docking station, but does not have external expansion cards.  A port replicator will allow the laptop to connect to a number of other peripheral devices.

#+caption: Look at all those ports!
#+ATTR_LATEX: width 0.6\textwidth :placement[h] :float nil
[[./images/1-3-PortReplicator.jpg]]

** Physical laptop lock and cable lock
One of greatest advantages of a laptop is also one of its big weaknesses.  It is light and mobile, which means that it is easier to steal.  Cable locks are a way of making your laptop more secure.

#+caption: A cable lock
#+ATTR_LATEX: width 0.5\textwidth :placement[h] :float nil
[[./images/1-3-cableLock2.jpeg]]
** Rotating/removable screens
Some laptops have displays that can be rotated or detatched, making them more like tablets.  These devices are more likely to have a digital stylus for input.

* 1.4 – Compare and contrast characteristics of various types of other mobile devices.

** Tablets
Tablets, in many ways, are sort of like giant smartphones and accomplish the same ends and share similar technologies.  Their operating systems can be Android (an open operating system developed by Google) or iOS (a proprietary operating system dseveloped by Apple).  

Generally measure between 6 and 11 inches diagonally.
** Smartphones
These are devices focussed on mobile communication, and in addition to voice commuication usually have access to email, productivity software, music or video.
** Wearable technology devices
*** Smart watches
Like smart phones, only smaller and on your wrist!  Wirelass ability can include WiFi, cellular, or Bluetooth / local connections to your phone.
*** Fitness monitors
Bands that can fit around your wrist or elsewhere to monitor things such as heartrate and respiration and send thjat data wirelessly to your phone or another compute.
*** VR/AR headsets
Still more promise than reality, designed to replace reality with a computer-generated version.  Could be used for games or industrial design.
** E-readers
Digital devices allowing the reading of books.  Share many characteristics with tablets and smartphones.
** GPS
Now more often incorporated in phones, GPS stands for "Global Positioning System) and uses satellites to fix your location.  Requires power and a view of the sky.

* 1.5 – Given a scenario, connect and configure accessories and ports of other mobile devices.

** Connection Types
*** Wired
**** Micro-USB / Mini-USB / USB-C
#+caption: Different mobile ports and connectors
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.6\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[./images/1-5-MobileDeviceConnectors.jpg]]

The timescale of adoption has gone like this: 
/even older connectors/ --> Mini USB-B --> Micro USB-B --> USB-C
**** USB connectors
- *USB-B*: Mini USB-B found only in older devices today.  The EU standardized Micro USB-B for most mobile devices
- *USB-C*: Newer USB format
  + 24-pin double-sided USB connector
  + Symmetrical
  + Can be used for both hosts and devices
  + Both USB 3.1 and USB 2.0
  + Can carry power, data, analog (audiio)


**** Lightning
- Proprietary Apple format
- 8-pin digital signals
- Used on iPad, iPhone, iPod
- Generally more durable than micro USB-B


**** Tethering
- Allows another device (laptop, desktop, other smartphones) to use your mobile device's internet connection
- Tethering can be wired (using USB / Lightning connectors
- or wireless, using Bluetooth
- Sometimes needs to be specifically enabled by a wireless carrier (Verizon!)
**** Proprietary vendor-specific ports (communication/power)
- Older connectors had diverse shapes and capabilities, with different connectors for power, data.
- A maddening situation that was mostly sorted out by the EU
*** Wireless
**** NFC
- *Near Field Communication* 
- Short range wireless communication using 13.56 MHz frequency
- Transmits 100-400 kb/s - not much! Slower than Bluetooth
- Used for transmitting data between devices (contact info, MP3s, photos)
- Also can communicate with POS terminals for contactless payment - acts like a smart card
- Also used with NFC tags
**** Bluetooth
- Widespread use in mobile devices
- Distance usually limited to about 33 feet (Class 2 Bluetooth)
- Can be used as part of a Personal Area Network (PAN)
- To prevent misuse and for protection of privacy, Bluetooth devices must be /paired/ with each other and you must approve the pairing on your mobile device.  To connect with another device, you will need to make your device *discoverable* - these days, the default is for your device to *not* be discoverable.
- Security via exchange of PINs
**** IR
- Communication over *infrared* - much higher frequency (430 THz to 300 GHz).
- This is what TV remotes usually use
- line of sight, slow
- Now only seen in very particular circumstances - not usually on flagship smartphones, for example.
**** Hotspot
- Setting up a hotspot allows other devices to share the internet connection of your portable device. This connection can be shared over a WiFi spectrum or over Bluetooth.  In effect, your device becomes a Wireless Access Point (WAP), and works as a router, assigning IP addresses over DHCP (which we will discuss in a bit!).
** Accessories
CompTIA lists this as one of its course objectives, to understand and describe various accessories.  For most of these, there are not any surprises nor much to know, really.  The exceptions are the terminology for waterproofing and they types of SD cards
*** Headsets
Just as in other devices, you can connect headsets to mobile devices.  Can be connect by wires or Bluetooth.  The classic 3.5mm audio jack seems to be gradually disappearing, but there will be adapters for any kind of connector.
*** Speakers
You can connect speakers too!  Wired or Bluetooth, sometimes NFC
*** Gamepads
?? These too, I suppose
*** Extra battery packs/battery chargers
- Mobile devices run out of power, usually sooner than you want.  Various kinds of things exist to help this.  These days, it is becoming harder and harder to find a smartphone with a removable battery.  But you can get external battery packs to provide additional power.
- Battery chargers allow charging your device from a wall socket.  The important thing is that it can fit into the charging port of your device (i.e. micro USB-B, USB-C, Thunderbolt,etc
*** Protective covers/waterproofing
- Smartphones and tablets all have various protective covers to place on them, from light and not so effective to much heavier ones.
- Waterproofing: IP code
  + *IP*- Ingress Protection.  Protection against dust and water, which are measured separately.  Lots of different IP ratings, and companies are caught trying to game them all the time.
  + An example: IP68.  First digit deals with dust, second with water.  "6" means the device is dust tight.  The second digit "8" means that the device can be immersed in water up to and beyond 1 meter, generally for 30 minutes.  But the exact depth and timing can vary between manufacturers.
*** Credit card readers
For various kinds of commerce, credit card readers can be attached to mobile devices, again through a wired or a Bluetooth connection
*** Memory/MicroSD
- On some phones, additional memory can be added using microSD cards (usually 32, 64, or 128 GB.  Most newer phones do not have the ability to place these cards, for the same reason that batteries are no longer removable - it can compromise the IP rating.  
- When memory expansion is available, SD cards can be inserted into a slot on the phone (much like a SIM card).  In older phones, the entire cover was taken off and the SD card could be placed in a specialized slot (right near the removable battery!)

* 1.6 – Given a scenario, configure basic mobile device network connectivity and application support.

** Wireless/cellular data network (enable/disable)
*** Hotspot
Discussed previously.  Often needs to be enabled by your cell provider
*** Tethering
Also discussed.  Also sometimes needs approval from or extra payment to your provider.
*** Airplane Mode
- Airplane mode is a connection setting in which all wireless connections are turned off.  
- So-called because it was believed that wireless connections could interfere with airplane instrumentation, so by engaging airplane mode you could still use your device wirelessly
- Airplane mode can be used to troubleshoot connections
- You can also serially re-enable features - for example only turning on WiFi but leaving cellular data off
- can conserve battery
*** OS settings
- iOS: Settings / Cellular
- Android: Settings / Wireless and network settings
** Bluetooth
*** Enable Bluetooth
- Short-range, usually 10 meters or so.  Part of a PAN (personal area network)
*** Enable pairing
Discussed above
*** Find a device for pairing
Discussed above
*** Enter the appropriate PIN code
Also above!
*** Test connectivity
Worth testing
** Corporate and ISP email configuration
*** Mail protocols

|----------------+----------------------+--------------------+-------------------------------|
- Sending mail - SMTP
- Retrieving mail - POP3, IMAP
*** Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)
- downloads email to local client
- optionally deletes from server
- configuration: 
  + name of POP3 server
  + Username and password
- network ports: 
  + POP3: tcp/110
  + SSL (Secure Socket Layer): POP3S: tcp/995
*** Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP4)

- IMAP4 can have folders
- configuration: 
  + name of IMAP server
  + username and password
- network ports:
  + IMAP: tcp/143
  + SSL: IMAPS: tcp/993
*** Sending email - SMTP
- Sending mail from device to mail server
- some kind of authentication required
- network ports:
  + SMTP without autherntication (now rarely used): tcp/25
  + with authentication: tcp/587
** Integrated commercial provider email configuration
*** iCloud
Apple email, IMAP4 only
*** Google/Inbox
- Google email, can use IMAP4 or POP3
- Can split emails into folders or tabs
- Inbox was cool but has been retired
*** Exchange Online
- Commercially available service version of corporate Exchange
*** Yahoo
- IMAP4 and POP3 support
- This still exists, as does AOL, oddly
** PRI updates / PRL updates / baseband updates
- A smartphone is a radio.  Cellular networks are very different from WiFi or Bluetooth
- Communications happen through a *baseband radio processor* 
- *PRL* - Preferred Roaming List
  + in CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access).  Allows phone to connect to the right tower.
  + Updated OTA (Over The Air)
- *PRI* - Product Release Instructions
  + Radio settings such as ID numbers, network codes, country codes
  + Updated OTA
** Radio firmware
- the radio processor has proprietary firmware, which must be updated occasionally
- Most updates done OTA, mostly invisible to user
** IMEI vs. IMSI
- *IMEI* - International Mobile Station Equipment Identity
  + Identifies an individual mobile device
  + Every phone has a different IMEI
- *IMSI* - International Mobile Subscriber Identity
  + Identifies the subscriber (you!)
  + Provisioned by the SIM card
** VPN
- *VPN* Virtual Private Network
  + We will discuss this concept further, later
  + But for now, this can turn your device into a VPN endpoint
  + VPNs allow for secure, encrypted communication between your device and a VPN server
  + When using VPN, your device appears to be on the network of the VPN server
  + This is often used when out of the office or home to access things that only authorized users of that network can access.
  + Can be part of the phone / device OS

* 1.7 – Given a scenario, use methods to perform mobile device synchronization.

** Synchronization methods
- What is synchronization and why do it?
- Being able to keep information current over all devices you use
- Now can be performed wirelessly (mobile network or 802.11 wireless) as your device communicated with different aspects of your identity and data
- There are dangers too!
*** Synchronize to the cloud
- Many things in your data world are probably already synchronized without you noticing
- That is how prevalent this system and concept is
- With Android - many services synchronized through Google
- Apple iOS - through iCloud
*** Synchronize to the desktop
- Depends on OS and sufficient disk space
*** Synchronize to the automobile
- via Bluetooth to media player / car computer
- Android Auto, iOS CarPlay
** Types of data to synchronize
- Contacts
- Applications
- Email
- Pictures
- Music
- Videos
- Calendar
- Bookmarks
- Documents
- Location data
- Social media data
- E-books
- Passwords
** Mutual authentication for multiple services (SSO)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) is an important (and cool) concept that will discuss again
- Simply, using a single identification to access multiple different services
- Without having to sign in each time
- Google and Apple use these widely for their services
** Connection types to enable synchronization
Although synchronization is now usually handled wirelessly, there was a time when it wasn't, and for some things you still need wires.  Here are some.

* 2.1 – Compare and contrast TCP and UDP ports, protocols, and their purposes.

** Brief Introduction to IP
- How do 1s and 0s move from one place to another over a network?
- Brief reflection on the absurdity of sending all those poor 1s and 0s by themselves
- We decided to put them in little boxes or *packets* that help them along their way
** Sketch of some packets
#+caption: Here are some packets
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width: 1.2\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[./images/2-1-IPpacketSketch.png]]
** TCP vs. UDP
*** *TCP* - Transmission Control Protocol
  + "Connection-oriented" - every packet is checked for delivery
  + /3-way handshake/:
    1. SYN: client computer initiates connection with a synchronization request (SYN packet)
    2. SYN + ACK: Server responds with a synchronization / acknowledgment packet
    3. ACK: Client sends acknowledgment packet
  + Then the connection is established - a /TCP socket connection/
  + Every single packet is accounted for in TCP - flow control, etc
*** *UDP* - User Datagram Protocol
+ "Connectionless sessions" - if a packet is missed or dropped, no big deal
+ This can be faster - none of that back and forth
+ But no error-connection
+ Good for things that are streaming, like voice or media where a few dropped packets won't change much

* 2.2 – Compare and contrast common networking hardware devices.
** Network Interface Card
- Found in /every/ device that attaches to the network
- Every NIC has a MAC address (Media Access Control)
- Specific to which type of connection - ethernet, wireless, etc
** Repeater
- Receives a signal and re-sends it
- No decisions or rules to follow
- Used to:
  + Boost connections
  + Convert from one network media to another (i.e. fiber --> copper)
  + Extend wireless LAN
** Hub
- "Multi-port repeater"
- Before routers, this is how data was distributed in network
- Everything half-duplex
- Less efficient as network speeds increase
** Bridge
- Makes packet forwarding decisions in software
- Connects different physical networks
- Distributes traffic based on MAC address
- Wireless Access Points act as bridges
** Switches
- Bridging done in hardware - faster
- Forwards traffic based on data link address
- Lots of ports, features, especially when managed
- Vital for large internal networks
- This is where VLANs are configured
*** Managed
- VLAN support
- Can organize traffic priorities (i.e. voice over data)
*** Unmanaged
- No configuration, no VPNs
- Cheap!
** Routers
- Routes traffic between subnets
- Makes forwarding decision based on IP address
- Can connect diverse network types
  + Can incorporate LAN, WAN, copper, fiber
** Access points
- A Wireless Access Point (WAP) is a bridge
- Makes forwarding decisions based on MAC address
** Firewall
- Filters traffic by port number
  + OSI Layer 4 (TCP / UDP)
- Vitally important for any network
- Provides protection against intrusion, by bots or individuals
** Cable modem
- Broadband modem
- Different types of traffic can be accommodated by modem
  + i.e. data, voice
- Data on a cable network:
  + DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification
- High speed - 4 Mbits/sec to 250 Mbits/sec
** DSL modem
- *DSL*- Digital Subscriber Line
  + ADSL - asymmetric, meaning that download is faster than upload
- Data over regular copper telephone line
- Needs to be ~10,000 feet from CO
- Speeds, errors decrease with distance from CO
- Highest speeds around 52 Mbits/sec, usually much much lower
** Patch panel
- Network of internal connections made from WAN
- RJ45 connections, individual runs made to wall or floor sockets
** Power over Ethernet (PoE)
Power can be routed along Ethernet cables, very useful especially for distant or hard-to-reach areas
*** Injectors
- Injectors placed alongside cable initiation
#+caption: POE injector
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width: 0.4\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[./images/2-2-POEinjector.jpg]]

*** Switch
- POE can be injected by special switches
** Ethernet over Power
- Power-line communication (PLC)
- Data flows along household electrical wires
- All kinds of problems with electrical junctions, often slow and subject to interference
** Addendum: OSI Model
The OSI model is not specifically part of the A+ 1001 objectives, but it is a model that you will see throughout your time in IT.  My experience is that having even a vague understanding of this model will help you sort out the nature and purpose of some of the network devices we have just talked about.

So mostly this is just here for you to look at so that you will recognize the terms later.

* 2.3 – Given a scenario, install and configure a basic wired/wireless SOHO network.
- SOHO - Small Office / Home Office
- A cool online resource: practice on a virtual Linksys router:
     + http://ui.linksys.com/WRT54G/v8/8.00.0/StaRouter.htm

** Router/switch functionality
- Standard SOHO router is an all-in-one device:
  + Modem, router, switch, Wireless Access Point, firewall, etc
#+caption: A Linksys WRT 1900 AC - router, wireless and wired connections
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.75\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[./images/2-3-LinksysRouter.jpg]]
#+REVEAL: split
- Connecting the WAN
- Wired connection to local devices
- Unless you want specialized stuff (VLANs, etc) switching and routing happens under the hood
** Wireless Access Point settings
- Enable and set different frequencies - 2.4GHz / 5 GHz
- These days most routers will have both
- Configure SSID - this is the /name/ of the WAP that is broadcast
  + Eternal question of different SSIDs for frequencies
  + Most routers and devices can auto-switch frequencies to some degree
#+REVEAL: split
- Security mode
  + WPA2 preferable - WEP vulnerable, WPA (WiFi Protected Access) vlunerable as well
- In order of decreasing security:
  1. WPA2 + AES (Advanced Encryption Security)
  2. WPA + AES
  3. WPA + TKIP/AES
  4. WPA + TKIP
  5. WEP
  6. Open network (no security)
#+REVEAL: split
- Selecting channels: other nearby WAPs can crowd channels
- Some WAPs / routers can scan local wireless channels; apps for phones and computers can do this as well
** IP addressing
- On WAN side: IP address usually assigned by ISP via DHCP
- LAN side:
  + Internal IP address, subnet mask of router
  + DHCP address range for other devices on network
  + DNS server address can be set manually, but are often the ISP's by default
** NIC configuration
*** Wired
- Wired ports on router usually pre-configured
- auto speed and duplex by default
*** Wireless
- Mostly just enable / disable
** End-user device configuration
- Usually done automatically, will set up speed, duplex, and DHCP without intervention from user
- But there are many things you can change:
  + subnet mask
  + Default gateway
  + DNS servers
** IoT device configuration
- Oh, the Internet of Things
- Very hip and buzzy term, but encompasses a wide range of interesting devices
- Usually involving home automation and the communication between various appliances / devices and things on the LAN or WAN
- Many security issues, but can be fun and handy
*** Thermostat
Thermostat can be set remotely, can be set to change depending on temperature, can be set to start heating / air conditioning when you leave work
*** Light switches
Same - remote turning on / off, can be set to change colors / brighness on time of day and your activities
*** Security cameras
- i.e. Nest, Ring (controversial issue with police seeking data)
- other security cameras can be set up and monitored remotely
*** Door locks
- Can be set to open to particular people, only at particular times, etc.  Can also be managed remotely, in conjunction with a security camera perhaps
** Cable/DSL modem configuration
- "Modem" - /Mo/dulator /dem/odulator
- Converts analog signals to digital signals
- Both will have particular settings, usually managed by your ISP
- Fiber does not use a "modem" but uses a similar device called an ONT (Optical Network Terminal) which divides up and apportions the signal (voice, data, telephone, televison)
** Firewall settings
*** DMZ - Demilitarized Zone
#+caption: DMZ, WAN, and LAN
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.8\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[./images/2-3-DMZ.jpg]]
- If you are running a service that requires access to and from the WAN (mail server, media server, Minecraft server, etc) place in the DMZ to protect your LAN
- But generally don't do this from home, and often more secure to use port forwarding
*** NAT
- *NAT* - Network Address translation
- Router translates all internal LAN IP addresses (i.e. 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x) to the external IP address of the router
- This is required due to limitations of IPv4

#+REVEAL: split
- Outside access to a serve hosted on a machine in the LAN
- External IP and port number mapped by router to an internal machine
- Can be called Static NAT or Destination NAT
*** UPnP
- *UPnP* Universal Plug and Play
- Allowed network devices to automatically find and join LAN
- As you can imagine, this seemed like a good idea but turned out to be ahuge security risk
- You should almost always disable UPnP
*** Whitelist/blacklist
- You can set up your firewall to only allow in approved connections (whitelisting). This is hard to maintain, especially if others are using your internet
- Or deny access from things you don't like (blacklisting)
  + Can block specific domains, IP addresses, sites ,even geographic regions
*** MAC filtering
- Remember how the MAC (Media Access Control) address is like the individual name of the device (Layer 2 of OSI model)?
- So you can restrict access to your internet to only specific MAC addresses, allowing only known, pre-approved devices to have access to your network
- This seems like it would be a good security idea, right?
- Except it isn't.  MAC addresses can be spoofed and rewritten on the device's NIC, and all an intruder would need to do would be to discover one of the approved MAC addresses and spoof it.
- "Security through obscurity" - not the last time you will hear this
** QoS
- *QOS* - Quality of Service.
  + Can rank priority of different services or protocols on your network regarding access to bandwidth.
  + VOIP usually high
  + Can even set this by time of day - only give priority to large downloads late at night for example
  + Can even rank particular ports, applications, or machines by MAC address as higher priority
** Wireless settings

| Standard |             | per stream  | total       | streams   |                        |
|----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----------+------------------------|

| 802.11ac | 5GHz        | 866.7 Mbps  | 6.8 Gbps    | 8 MU-MIMO | 175+ feet indoors      |
|----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----------+------------------------|

MIMO - Multiple Input and Multiple Output.  Increases speed by using multiple antennas exploiting multipath propagation

Transmission Range - strongly affected by indoor building materials


** 802.11a
- a and b were the first wireless standards, in 1999
- a operates in 5 Ghz range
- 5 GHz is a higher frequency - more likely to be affected by objects and materials
- But generally a less crowded frequency
** 802.11b
- in 2.4 GHz
- 2.4 GHz has better range, but more prone to interference 
- many electronic devices broadcast on 2.4 GHz range - microwave ovens, cordless phones, baby monitors
** 802.11g
  - Also 2.4 GHz, in 2003
  - backwards compatible with 802.11b
** 802.11n
- Update in 2009, transmits at 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz
- First protocol to use MIMO, enable faster theoretical speeds, as long as the receiving device supports MIMO
** 802.11ac
- Update to protocol in 2014
- 5 GHz only
- if devices can support MIMO, theoretically very fast
** Frequencies
*** 2.4 GHz
- as above, less prone to interference from intervening materials, but more crowded spectrum
*** 5 GHz
- Theoretically faster, less prone to interference on spectrum
** Channels
- Channels have different bandwidths
- 802.11a, b, and g had 20 MHz channel widths
- 802.11n was able to first bond channels together, using 40 MHZ channels
  + However, 40 MHz channel in 2.4 GHz soaks up a lot of the bandwidth - if you have neighbors, this is not very kind
- 802.11ac uses 80 MHz and up to 160 MHz channels
** Wireless spectra and channels
#+caption: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectra and available channels in North America
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1.2\textwidth
[[./images/2-4-WirelessSpectrumsNA.png]]

Non-available frequencies are usually those preserved for the use of aviation and military

** RFID
- *RFID* - Radio Frequency Identification
  + Access badges, inventory management, even a way of tracking my cat!
** Zigbee
- An IOT communication protocol
- travels further than Bluetooth, uses less energy than WiFi
- used or "smart" lightbulbs, doors, robo-vacuums
** Z-Wave
- Another IOT communication protocol
- doors, locks, lights, others
- 900 MHz frequency, little competition in this wavelength
** 2G
- back into cellular networking
- 2G one of the first cellular network protocols
- Where GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) split
- OK for voice, terrible for data
** 3G
- 1998
- Slightly better for data, allowed use of GPS, first attempts at mobile video
** 4G
- 2009, first deployed in Sweden
- Also known as LTE, EDGE (some confusing and conflicting terminology)
- GSM and CDMA converge
- Download rates of 150 Mbps
- LTE-A (LTE Advanced)
  + Download rates up to 300 Mbps
** 5G
- Being implemented as we speak
- Performance improvements but only at higher frequencies - in dense urban environments

* 2.5 – Summarize the properties and purposes of services provided by networked hosts.

** Server roles
- People make a big deal about the names and roles of different kinds of servers, but when you come right down to it, a server is a computer.  In corporate or research environments, individual computers might perform a single function.  But in most environments, individual computers can serve multiple server roles
- This is especially true with the use of virtual machines - many different machines can live in one machine
*** Web server
- Serves web pages and other resources accessed using HTTP and HTTPS protocols
- Web pages can have their own dynamic processes, being rebuilt on each visit or being static
- People have particular feelings about each type of page
- Some web pages can essentially run their own tiny operating systems and programs
*** File server
- Storage of documents, photos, media
- These are where Server Message Block (SMB) and Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) live
- These are the machines most likely to have enormous storage drives, RAID systems (which we will discuss in a bit)
*** Print server
- manages printers and printing tasks
- usually only found in larger network environments
- Printer protocols:
  + LPD (Line Printer Daemon)
  + IPP (Internet Printing Protocol)
*** DHCP server
- *DHCP* - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- Assigns IP addresses to individual devices on the network
- In home environment, included in the router
- In large, enterprise environments this is a crucial service - if DHCP goes down, the network starts losing its ability to talk to itself
*** DNS server
- Domain Name System
  + Text names to IP addresses
  + Extremely important in enterprise scenarios
*** Proxy server
- Server which stands between user and the WAN
- Serves to protect user, also can restrict where the user can go and what they can do
- Common in academic environments
*** Mail server
- Manages email services
- Crucial in any environment, and extremely complicated to set up and maintain
*** Authentication server
- Using applications such as LDAP and Active Directory, manages sign-on and authentication services
- Extremely important for security
- Not the kind of thing you use at home
*** SIEM
- Security Information and Event Management
  + logs security issues, intrusion detection
- maintains logs of user access to different parts of network
*** syslog
- Another crucial system for maintaining a network
- A syslog server will maintain log files from other machines on the network
- massive amounts of space needed, often redundant servers to protect information
- logs are very important for reconstructing bad events and fixing them, making sure they don't happen again
** Internet appliance

*** IDS
- *IDS* - Intrusion Detection System.  Sounds alert if sneaky and bad things are happening - bot attacks, scripting, buffer and kernal overflows
*** IPS
- *IPS* - Intrusion Prevention System
- Not just reporting like IDS, but actively thwarting attacks
- FailToBan being a minor example of the kinds of things IPS does
*** UTM
- *UTM* - Unified Threat Management
- Very sophisticated firewall with IDS and IPS built in
- Designed to handle everything - malware, worms, viruses, bad actors, monitors bandwidth use
*** End-point management server
- The server to manage servers
** Legacy/embedded systems
- *Legacy* - IT term for devices / software that are old but still useful.  Many examples of this.
  + Often simply too expensive or time-consuming to replace
  + This is why old COBOL engineers get called up out of retirement
- *Embedded Systems* - An electronic device that is simple and only does one thing.  Can manage alarms, door access, sensors, etc.  Will be linked to network, wired or wireless.
\newpage
* 2.6 – Explain common network configuration concepts.
** DHCP
- Before DHCP, all IP addresses on the network were set manually
- This was a huge pain and could lead to all kinds of problems with different IP address conflicts
- DHCP automates the process and makes it much smoother
- DHCP Process:
  1. Discover
  2. Offer
  3. Request
  4. Acknowledge

#+REVEAL: split
- IP addresses can still be figure manually on each device, but if you are administering a network this should be discouraged
*** Reservations
- Instead, better to set a static address on the router by setting an IP *reservation* and associating an IP address with the device's MAC address

** IP addressing
*** Static
- IP addresses stay the same; the external address of your home internet will stay the same for long periods of time, or forever
- Particular devices on a network may benefit from having static IP addresses rather than being frequently changed by DHCP
  + These would include printers, file, DNS, or authentication servers
  + Static IP addresses can bet up on each individual device, with different procedures in each operating system
*** Dynamic
- Changing, usually assigned by DHCP
- DHCP usually keeps addresses for a week
*** APIPA
- Automatic Private IP Addressing
- When a device cannot contact the DHCP server, it makes up its own IP address in the range 169.254.1.0 - 169.254.255.254
- Then it keeps trying to find the DHCP server
** DNS
- As discussed previously, the *Domain Name System* (or *Domain Name Server*) 
- In setting up a network, the DNS server can be set up in the router, and can also be set up on each machine individually to override the server setting
- Many different top-level DNS services

** IPv4 vs. IPv6
- Internet Protocol version 4: OSI level 3 address
- IPv4 is the IP address format you recognize, and will probably continue to use for some time.
- But many drawbacks, the main one being that we are out of addresses! This is why we need to use NAT.
- IPv6 will not need to use NAT.
#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: IPv4 address format
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width: 0.4\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[./images/2-6-IPv4.png]]

#+caption: IPv6 address format
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
[[./images/2-6-IPv6.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

- IPv6 is a 128-bit address - there are 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses (340 undecillion)


** Subnet mask
- In IPv4, the subnet mask helps the local device to determine its subnet
- in a standard LAN subnet mask can look like this: 255.255.255.0
- You will not need ot know exactly how this works, (yet!)
** Gateway
- IP address of the router that governs your access to the WAN
** VPN
- Uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to create encrypted connection with network, from outside the network
** VLAN
- Think we have discussed this, briefly?
- *Virtual Local Area Network* - group of devices in the same broadcast domain
- A logical division rather than a physical one
** NAT
- As mentioned, only necessary because of the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses

* 2.7 – Compare and contrast Internet connection types, network types, and their features.

** Internet connection types

*** Cable & DSL
- Discussed above
*** Dial-up
- Old school - establishing network connection over phone lines
- top speeds 320 kbps
*** Fiber
- Highest speed connection currently available to homes
- High bandwidth, can bundle phone, TV, data
- Speeds up to 1 Gbit/sec
*** Satellite
- Sometimes the only available option in extremely rural areas
- expensive, high latency
- line of sight, vulnerable to weather

*** ISDN
- Ancient but still on the A+ exam, still in use as legacy systems for business (more likely to be a backup connection now).  Two subtypes:
- BRI - Basic Rate Interface
  + Two 64 kbit/s bearer channels
  + One 16 kbit/s signalling channel

* 3.3 – Given a scenario, install RAM types.

** RAM types

*** Overview of memory terms
- RAM is for temporary, fast storage of data.  It can be thought of as the working memory of the computer.
- Not to be confused with long-term storage such as HDDs or SDDs
- Insufficient or underperforming RAM can be a bottleneck in the performance of the computer
#+REVEAL: split
- Desktop RAM: Dual-inline memory modules (DIMMs)
- Laptop RAM: Small outline DIMMs (SO-DIMMs)
- Both use Double Data Rate (DDR) technology
- DDR doubles the data per cycle compared to older types
*** RAM numerology
- The numbers in the name of the RAM tell you about the speed:
  - e.g. a stick of DDR2 RAM called DDR2-800 or PC2-6400:
  - 800 million transfers per second (MT/s)
  - 6400 MB/s
*** SDR vs DDR
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width: 0.8\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
#+CAPTION: SDR vs DDR
[[/Users/nick/org/comptia/sessionOne/images/3-3-SDRvsDDR.png]]
*** DDR2
- decreased voltage compared to DDR1
- increased speed through faster signalling, thus more pins
- 240 pins
*** DDR3
- lower power consumption, higher speed
- also 240 pins but /not/ backwards compatible with DDR2
- maximum 16GB per DIMM

| DDR3         | 240 pins       |
| DDR4         | 288 pins       |

*** How to install RAM:
1. Full static precautions!
2. Orient the RAM properly, paying attention to notches
3. Insert RAM into slot
4. Press down with both thumbs until the ears lock
5. Test

This is worth watching, because it takes you through the entire process of installing RAM.  This is exactly the kind of thing you might need to regurgitate in a Practice-Based Question

** Single channel
- Original RAM architecture.
- One 64-bit address bus
- Each stick of RAM must share this channel
** Dual channel
- Doubles data throughput
- Two separate 64-bit channels, a 128-bit bus
- Color-coded matching banks on motherboard
** Triple channel
- Accesses three memory modules at the same time
- A 192-bit bus
** Quad channel
- Quad-channel architecture requires 4 identical memory modules placed in the correct slots
- Most common with DDR4
- Four 64-bit wide buses

#+CAPTION: Quad-channel slots on a motherboard
[[/Users/nick/org/comptia/sessionOne/images/3-3-quad-channel-slots.png]]
** Parity vs. Non-parity
- A "parity check" is a data validation technique
- Extra bit is stored to check previous bits (thus 9 bits for every byte)
  - Important for applications that require data integrity such as servers or workstations
  - more expensive, slightly slower
** Error correcting
- ECC (Error Correction Code) detects /and/ corrects errors
- Slowest and most expensive
** A last word about RAM
- The main thing to remember is that RAM must be /compatible/ with the motherboard
- And the best way to determine this is to go through your motherboard manual to see the compatible types of RAM
* 3.4 – Given a scenario, select, install and configure storage devices.
- Here, we will focus on the following:
  - Optical drives
  - Solid state devices (SSDs)
  - Magnetic hard drives (HDDs)
  - Hybrid drives
  - Flash drives
  - RAID

** Optical drives
- Data storage format: tiny bumps read by a laser beam
  - Microscopic binary storage
- Three main types:
  - Compact discs (CDs)
  - Digital versatile discs (DVDs)
  - Blu-ray discs
*** CD-ROM/CD-RW
- CD-ROM: Read-only-memory
- CD-RW: Re-Writable
- Speeds: multiples of 150 KB/s
  - for example, 48x
  - 48x = 48 * 150 KB = 7.2 MB/s
- Typical capacity: 700 MB

#+REVEAL: split
| Technology | Full name     | Max recording speed             |
|------------+---------------+---------------------------------|
| CD-R       | CD-Recordable | 48x (7.2 MB/s) or 52x (7.8 MB/s |
| CD-RW      | CD-ReWritable | 24x (3.6 MB/s or 32x (4.8 MB/s) |

** Configurations

*** RAID 0,1,5,10
- Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)
  - Designed to increase the speed of reading and writing data, or
  - Create fault-tolerant volumes, or
  - Both
- For exam, know RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10
*** Setting up RAID
- Two or more hard drives
- Software or hardware-based
  - Hardware is faster:
    - Need built-in RAID support on motherboard, or
    - RAID adapter card, or
    - External device such as Network-Attached Storage (NAS)
*** RAID 0
- Striping
- High performance, data read and written quickly
- No redundancy!
- One failure away from breaking everything
*** RAID 1 
- Mirroring
- File blocks are duplicated between two or more drives
*** RAID 5
- Striping with parity
- Requires at least 3 disks
- File blocks are striped
- High redundancy, but possibly slower performance
*** RAID 10
- A stripe of mirrors
- Speed of striping, redundancy of mirroring
- Need at least 4 drives
*** A Diagram of RAID

- (except for RAID 0)
*** Fault tolerance is not backup!
- It really isn't, don't get fooled
- Two RAID drives can fail at the same time, destroying the whole thing.

*** CMOS battery
- In the olden days, user BIOS settings were stored in:
  - A Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor
    - which is a type of memory that needed power to retain data
  - Would have a battery, could be removed to reset BIOS settings
- These days, stored in flash memory - move a jumper to reset

** CPU features

*** Single core CPU
- Back when a CPU was just its own thing, one unit
*** Hyperthreading
- Next step: 
  - A single CPU can accept and process two or more sets of instructions simultaneously
  - OS sees more than one CPU
*** Multicore
- Dual-core, quad-core, etc
- Each core can have its own cache or can share cache with other cores
- Multicore CPUs usually have hyperthreading as well
*** CPU cache

*** Speeds
- "Clock speed" of CPU
  - Megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz)
- Actual speed is a combination of many factors
  - Bus architecture, CPU memory cache sizes, operating system
  - Don't see CPUs being marketed with GHz any more
*** Overclocking
- Can increase the clock speed of a CPU past its recommended value
  - Produces more heat, CPU can become unstable
  - Or even break, bringing more of your system down with it
  - Will generally void your warranty!
*** Integrated GPU
- Graphics require additional calculation and processing
- In the olden days this was always done by a separate component
- Now the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is usually integrated into the CPU
- In desktops and some laptops, can add additional graphics card to do this.

** Compatibility of different CPUs

  - In a desktop, the PSU is inside the case
  - In a laptop, it is usually external and we sometimes call it a "power brick"
*** Destop power supply unit

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
#+CAPTION: Laptop power brick
[[/Users/nick/org/comptia/sessionOne/images/3-7-LaptopPowerBrick.jpg]]
- The "brick" is what converts AC to DC, with the leads going to the wall power socket and the laptop power socket visible

** Input 115V vs. 220V
- US is 110-120V, most of the rest of the world is 220-240V
- Most of the time this can be handled automatically by the power supply
- But not always - sometimes a switch on the back (see picture of desktop PSU)
- Look at inscription on power brick to make sure
  - if it says "INPUT: 100-240V, 50/60 Hz" then it can be used in either 115V or 220V power settings without additional work
