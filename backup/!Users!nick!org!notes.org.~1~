** Cover sentence
I am trained as a physician, and I have worked extensively in public mental health.  I have experience working with patients in the community, traveling to their homes for in-person interviews and care. I have led clinical teams in both inpatient and outpatient settings. I believe that patients should feel that they are partners in their own care.

** Cover letter

Dear Recruiting team at Athena Consulting,

My name is Nicholas Taintor, and I am a physician living in Fairfax, Virginia.  I am writing to express my interest in the position of Case Investigator, with the Commonwealth of Virginia COVID-19 contact tracing effort.  I found notification of this position through the VDH website.

I believe that my medical and personal background makes me a strong candidate for this position.  I have spent my career learning how to conduct diagnostic and therapeutic interviews in a way that is empathic, sensitive, and mindful of confidentiality.  I understood early in my training that without a person's trust, there was little chance that they would follow my suggestions, no matter how correct or well-meant they might be.

I have a strong interest in medical informatics and have worked with a number of different electronic health record systems. I have contributed code and knowledge to a program helping to promote the use of the Veterans Administration electronic health record (VistA / CPRS) around the world.  These skills will help me document and present all of my interactions with, and findings from, persons believed to be infected with COVID-19.

In my view, the best kind of medicine and care happen when colleagues work with and learn from each other.  Helping to put a team together and learning how to work as a cohesive unit has always been my favorite part of any new job, and I look forward to being able to practice those skills. 

Although my residency training was in psychiatry, at New York University we were granted some leeway in our training.  Unlike most of my psychiatric colleagues, I asked for clinical rotations in medicine, infectious diseases, and oncology.  I spent three months working in the ICU at Bellevue Hospital helping to treat patients in advanced phases of illness.  I was the primary physician for a patient with one of the first locally-acquired cases of fulminant malaria seen in New York for years, and worked with epidemiologists to clarify the origins of that case. 

I have spent much of my medical career working in public health, and usually with people who are underserved by existing medical systems.  Learning how to earn the trust and partnership of people who might have a natural and understandable mistrust of medicine and authority is not easy or simple.  But it is the most important part of the process.

I trained at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, which is (in my view) the most vital public health institution in that city.  This is a place where people come when they do not have health insurance and often lack many other types of social support.  I learned from the best, there, about how to bring people in from the community and help them realize the ways in which they could get better.  I worked in the Free Clinic at Bellevue during medical school and residency and began to understand how to work with a diverse community of people who were very different from me.

Helping people to change their behavior is the basis of any worthwhile medical intervention.  Sometimes this is something simple, such as getting people to stop doing something that is hurting them such as smoking or excessive alcohol consumption.  At other times this is more complex - getting people to do something difficult and unpleasant with an unclear and distant payoff.  

During this COVID-19 pandemic, and as part of the contact tracing program, we will be asking people to isolate or quarantine themselves for the good of others.  This will require ongoing care and relationship-building with people who will be in a difficult and frightening situation - in a crisis, to put it simply.  I believe that my previous experience, along with my desire and willingness to learn more, will make me a valuable part of this program.

I will be ready to put my skills to work for the Commonwealth of Virginia, and more importantly to learn how I can contribute best to the effort.  I look forward to being a part of this important project.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to look through my application materials.
