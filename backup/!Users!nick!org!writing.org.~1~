Hey all!

I apologize -- I had thought that you all were simply  asking me for a referral to a neurologist in the area, which unfortuanetely I am in no position to provide at the moment.  There was really only one around here that I saw eye-to-eye with, and she got married and moved to Portland.

Also, I was thinking that it didn't really matter much who Dorna's next neurologist was - as far as I can tell there is no real mystery as to what is going on.  Dorna just needs someone who knows their left from their right and has a valid medical license.  At this point a reasonably well-trained monkey could figure out what to do next.

I did not realize we were having issues and questions about the dosage and formulation of lamotrigine, and I can help with that and make it all very simple.

But first of all, seizures are terrifying.  As far as I know I've never had one, but I do understand the frustration and anxiety of not knowing if a particular medication will work or not, and the desire to get a definitive answer about what's what.  Seizures are terrifying to neurologists as well, because they can be unpredictable and have scary consequences and sometimes they respond to medication and sometimes they don't.

So here are some very simple things about lamotrigine:
   * There is no "therapeutic" serum level of lamotrigine, either for neurological or psychiatric purposes.  Psychiatrists and neurologists both get confused about this.
