* CompTIA A+ 1002

Just as in the 1001, the 1002 has partcular components that are covered.  Here is the breakdown:

| Domain | Substance                | percent |
|--------+--------------------------+---------|
|      1 | Operating Systems        |     27% |
|      2 | Security                 |     24% |
|      3 | Software Troubleshooting |     26% |
|      4 | Operational Procedures   |     23% |
|--------+--------------------------+---------|

* 1.1 – Compare and contrast common operating system types and their purposes.
** What is an OS and why do you need one?
- Interaction between components of machine
  - Many 1s and 0s are passed between the CPU, RAM, keyboard, video and sound cards
  - Someone needs to manage this at a higher level so that the user can participate
- Common platform for applications to work on / together
- Also provides bridge between humans and computer 
** Standard OS features
- File management
- Application support
- Input / output support
  - Printers, keyboards, hard drives, USB
  - It's sort of like a higher-level BIOS, right?
** 32-bit vs. 64-bit
- Pretty much all PCs being produced today are 64-bit
- But you will see 32-bit machines in the field
  - You may see 16-bit machines, but probably only museum pieces
  - First 32-bit CPU in 1985: Intel 386DX
*** RAM limitations
- 32-bit CPUs are limited to 4 GB of RAM
- 64-bit CPUs have a default maximum of 256 TB and could be extended to 4 petabytes (PB)
  - (though no one would do that, yet)
  - RAM is limited by the operating system:
    - Windows 7 64-bit can go to 192 GB
    - Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit can handle up to 512 GB
    - Windows 10 Pro 64-bit can handle up to 2 TB
*** Software Compatibility
- Most editions of Windows are still available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions
  - There are 32-bit and 64-bit versions of most major Linux distributions as well
  - The most recent macOS (Catalina) is 64-bit only, and will not run 32-bit programs
  - Whereas 64-bit Windows can still run 32-bit programs
*** Where Windows keeps it
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- 64-bit system files and apps are in ~C:\Windows\System32~
- 32-bit system files and apps are in ~C:\Windows\SysWOW64~
  - Yes, this makes very little sense
  - Based in the development of Windows from 32-bit to 64-bit
*** Slightly confusing code:
- x86 = 32-bit
- x64 = 64-bit (and often called AMD64)
  
** Workstation operating systems
- By "workstation," CompTIA means a desktop or laptop that someone sits at and does work
- So we are not including further discussion of servers for the rest of this course
*** Microsoft Windows

#+ATTR_HTML: :style float:left; margin:75px ; width: 100px;
[[./images2/1-1-windows10.png]]
- By far the most common
- Different versions: 
  - You will be expected to know 7, 8, 8.1, and 10
  - There are others that you will not have to know, such as Windows Server
- Advantages and disadvantages:
  - Good - big presence means big support
    - Lots of different kinds of software
  - Bad - Large target for security exploitation
    - So much different hardware, so many versions still running
*** Apple Macintosh OS
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.15\textwidth :placement [h]
#+ATTR_HTML: :style float:left; margin:50px ; width: 100px; 
[[./images2/1-1-apple-emblem.jpg]]
- Advantages:
  - easy to use
  - always compatible
  - few security concerns
  - free with Apple hardware

#+REVEAL: split
- Disadvantages:
  - Requires Apple hardware
  - Less industry support
  - Hardware more expensive

*** Chrome OS
- Google's operating system, based on Linux kernel
- Its relationship with Android can be confusing
- Google Chrome browser is essentially its own operating system, and Chrome OS is based on this

** Vendor-specific limitations

*** End-of-life
- EOL - when a company stops supporting a package
- Companies set their own EOLs, they vary by software package
*** Update limitations
- iOS, Android, and Windows 10 check for updates and prompt to update
- ChromeOS updates automatically
- Linux you gotta do it yourself
** Compatibility concerns between operating systems
- Applications designed for one OS generally cannot run on a different OS
- They must be specifically built to run on different OSs
- Many data files can work between operating systems: images, videos, sound files

* 1.2 – Compare and contrast features of Microsoft Windows versions.

** Windows 7

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1.2\textwidth :placement [H] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 99%
[[./images2/1-2-windows10.png]]
** Corporate vs. personal needs
- Many aspects of Windows designed for "the enterprise"
*** Domain access
- Using Active Directory Domain Services
  - People in the know talk about AD as being the best piece  of software Microsoft ever produced
  - Can keep track of accounts and users across the entire enterprise
  - Distributed architecture
*** Domain Access cont'd
- Many different uses:
  - Authentication
  - Centralized management
  - SSO (single sign-on), the holy grail of domain management
*** BitLocker
- BitLocker is Full Disk Encryption (FDE)
- Every single thing is encrypted
*** EFS
- Encrypting File System
- Encrypt files one-by-one
*** Media center
- Video, music, and television portal
- Was discontinued; not available in Windows 10
- So people figure out how to put it back in
*** BranchCache
- Caching for branch offices
- Reduces bandwidth use over long distances

** Desktop styles/user interface
- Flexibility and personalization of desktop limited at work
- Much more flexible in home editions without the central control

* 1.3 – Summarize general OS installation considerations and upgrade methods.

** Boot methods
- Operating systems can be installed from different media
*** USB
- USB needs to be bootable
- Computer needs to support booting from USB
*** CD-ROM
- You don't see it quite as much any more, but used to be the standard way
*** DVD
- See this a little more because it can hold more data
- But, especially in laptops, see fewer DVD drives
*** PXE
- "pixie"
- Preboot eXecution Environment
- perform a remote network installation
*** Solid state/flash drives
- Another possible media
*** NetBoot
- Apple technology for booting  Macs from network
- Similar to PXE
*** External/hot-swappable drive
- External CD-ROM / DVD
*** Internal hard drive (partition)
- Can install and boot from separate drive
- Can mount an .iso
** Type of installations

*** Unattended installation
- Can set up answers to Windows questions in a file
- So that there are no interruptions
*** In-place upgrade
- Maintain existing applications and data
*** Clean install
- Wipe eveything and reinstall 
*** Repair installation
- Fixes problems with the Windows OS
  - Doesnot touch user files
*** Multiboot
- Running two ormore operating systems from the same computer
*** Remote network installation
*** Image deployment
- Easier way to do mass installations
- Deploy a clone on every computer
*** Recovery partition
- A hidden partition with recovery files
*** Refresh/restore
- Windows 8/10 feature to clean things up
- Requires a recovery partition

** Partitioning
- An ancient concept
  - Separates physical drive into logical pieces
  - Can keep data, operating systems distinct
- Formatted partitions are called volumes
  - (Microsoft terminology)
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.75\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
#+CAPTION: A diagram of partitioning concepts
[[./images2/1-3-partitioning.png]]
*** MBR
- Master Boot Record
  - one of the earliest ways of doing this
  - lots of limitations
*** Primary
- in MBR partitions;
  - a bootable partition
  - Maximum of four primary partitions per disk
*** Extended
- Extends the maximum number of partitions
*** GPT
- GUID Partition Table
  - The newest partition standard
  - Globally unique identifier
- Requires UEFI BIOS
  - Can have up to 128 primary partitions
  - Does not require extended partitions or any sneaky stuff to extend it


** File system types/formatting
- Before data can be written to the partition, it must be formatted
- Operating systems expect a particular format
  - FAT32 and NTFS currently most popular
    - but ext3 and ext4 coming up behind fast
*** FAT
- File Allocation Table
- Earliest; (1980ish)
*** FAT32
- Larger (2 TB file sizes)
- maximum file size of 4 GB
*** ExFAT
- Extended File Allocation Table
- Microsoft flash drive file system
- Files can be larger than 4 GB
*** NTFS
- NTFS - NT File System
  - Extensive improvements over FAT32
  - Quotas, file compression, encryption, symbolic links
*** CDFS
- Compact Disk File System
- All operating systems can read the CD
*** NFS
- Network File System
- Access files across the network as if they were local
*** ext3, ext4
- Third extended file system
- Fourth extended file system
- Generally on Linux systems
*** HFS
- HFS+ - Mac OS Extended
- Was replaced in 2017 by *Apple Filing System* (APFS) but CompTIA does not seem to have caught on to this yet
  - Optimized for flash and solid-state drives, with emphasis on encryption
*** Swap partition
- CPU temporarily uses part of a hard drive when it runs out of RAM
  - Frees RAM by moving data to disk
  - Has to be a very fast magnetic drive or an SSD
*** Quick format vs. full format
- Quick:
  - Creates new file table
  - Data *appears* to be erased but it is not
    - Quick format in Windows 7, 8, 10
      - use ~diskpart~ for full format
*** Full format
- Writes zeroes to the entire disk
- You data is unrecoverable
** Load alternate third-party drivers when necessary
- Sometimes your devices will not have drivers built into the OS
- Then will need to get them from the manufacturer
** Workgroup vs. Domain setup
- Workgroups vs domains:
  - *Domain* a group of computers that share a common user account database.  Users can log in to access shared resources
  - *Workgroup* a simpler concept, a group of computers that share resources such as printers and files.  But each computer keeps track of its own user accounts, no centralized management.
- At home: workgroup
- At work: domain
** Time/date/region/language settings
- Basic settings that we sometimes forget!
** Driver installation, software, and Windows updates
- Before you can say that you are finished installing an operating system:
  - Load video drivers, install apps, update OS
** Factory recovery partition
- A hidden partition that will allow you to reset your operating system to its original state
- Could be useful later; but this is not as useful a feature as it used to be
- The problem is that it erases everything and starts over
** Properly formatted boot drive with the correct partitions/format
- Make sure you know the partitions that are there
- Is there old data on there?
- Backup the data you need
  - Always backup before you do anything big!
** Prerequisites/hardware compatibility
- Before installation make sure you meet minimum OS requirements
  - Memory, disk space, etc.
- Run a hardware compatibility checker
  - i.e. Windows 10 Upgrade Checker
** Application compatibility
- Make sure your apps will still work after the upgrade
  - Need to check with manufacturer
  - 32-bit vs 64-bit etc (especially with macOS)
** OS compatibility/upgrade path
- Different upgrade paths for different versions of Windows
** Windows 8 upgrade path
- [[color:green][*Upgrade*]] = can perform in-place upgrade
- [[color:red][*Install*]] = must do clean install
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1.1\textwidth :placement [H] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 99%
#+CAPTION: Windows 8 upgrade path
[[./images2/1-3-windows8UpgradePath.png]]

* 1.4 – Given a scenario, use appropriate Microsoft command line tools.
** Command line
- Command line is where it is at
- Talking more directly to the computer
- When you get good at it, it can be faster and more rewarding than messing around in the GUI
- It is also more impressive to employers
- My prejudiced feeling is:
  - If you are serious about IT, you need to spend most of your time on the command line
** The Windows command line
- Microsoft calls this "the Command shell."
  - Windows really has two command shells: the Command shell and [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7][PowerShell]]
  - PowerShell resembles Command shell but is more for scripting and automation. 
    - You will not need to know PowerShell for the A+
** Command shell - the next generation
- There is a new version of Command shell, called Windows Terminal.  
  - It is open source and you can look at it [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7][here]]
  - People like me are happy because it has features of better  command lines and terminals in other operating systems
** Notes for this section
- Depending on the OS, the command line is called "the terminal" as well.
  - Things to be typed in the shell will look like this:
    - ~C:\>run COOLCOMMAND.EXE~
- Many commands have "switches" that change their actions:
  - e.g. ~chkdsk /f~ checks the disk and fixes system errors
- Notation conventions:
  - when something is surrounded by brackets ~[ ]~, this designates a generic placeholder
    - i.e. ~help [command]~ means that you can enter any command after ~help~

Look cool using [[https://hackertyper.net/][hackertyper]]

** Privileges in the CLI
- Different users have different privileges, different commands they may run
  - In Windows, some commands can only be run by the Administrator
    - "elevated privileges"
    - Right-click on Command Prompt, choose /Run as Administrator/
      - or if you want to be really cool, <windows>+R ~cmd~ <ctrl> <shift> <enter>
    - In Linux / macOS this is called "root privilege"
** Help in the Command shell
- can type ~help [command]~
  - ~> help chkdsk~
- can also use ~[command] /?~
- end shell session with ~exit~
  
** Navigation
- In a GUI, the graphical representation of the operating system, we talk about "folders." 
  - In the command line, they are "directories"
*** ~dir~
 - Lists files and directories
*** ~cd~
- Changes directory:
  - ~cd documents~ will enter the "documents" folder
  - use ~\~ to specify folder names, volumes 
*** ~..~
- Two periods / dots
- Signifies the directory above the current directory
  - ~.~ signifies the current directory

** Network Command line tools
- ~ipconfig~
  - the starting command for figuring out network problems
  - tells you your [local] IP address, DNS server, DHCP server, gateway, etc
  - ~ipconfig /all~ gives you the verbose information

*** Network CLI tools:
- ~ping~
  - Tests if an IP address is reachable
  - Tells you how long the signal takes to get there
  - Uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol
    - A very old and fun tool
*** Network CLI tools:
- ~tracert~
  - Traces the path taken by a packet to a destination
  - Uses ICMP Time To Live Exceeded message in an interesting way:
    - time in TTL is in hops, not time
    - TTL=1 is the first router
    - TTL=2 is the 2nd router
    - Not all routers respond to ICMP
*** More tracert
- Linux and macOS allow you to specify the protocol, if ICMP is blocked or disregarded
- Though in Linux and Unix it is called ~traceroute~
- iOS sends UDP over port 33434
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.90\textwidth :placement [H] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
#+CAPTION: Traceroute diagram
[[./images2/1-4-tracerouteDiagram.png]]
*** Network CLI tools:
- ~netstat~ shows network statistics for your local machine
- Seen in multiple OSs
  - ~netstat -a~ show all active connections
  - ~netstat -b~ displays the file using the port
  - ~netstat -n~ does not resolve names
*** Network CLI tools:
- ~nslookup~ Looks up information from DNS servers
  - Canonical names, IP addresses
*** Network CLI tools:
- ~net~
  - Windows network commands
    - See network resources:
      - ~net view \\<servername>~
      - ~net view /workgroup:<workgroupname>~
    - Map a network share to a drive letter:
      - ~net use h: \\<servername>\<sharename>~
    - See user account information:
      - ~net user <username>~

** ~shutdown~
- Shuts it down; with switches can change timing, restart it
  - ~shutdown /s /t nn~ wait nn seconds and shut down
  - ~shutdown /r /t nn~ shut down and restart after nn seconds
  - ~shutdown /a~ abort the shutdown
  - ~shutdown /m \\<computer>~ shuts down another computer
  - ~shutdown /c "<comment>"~ sends a message about why the computer is shutting down
    - (don't need to know that last one)
** ~dism~
- Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
  - manage and deploy Windows OS images
  - can automate this for deployment
** ~sfc~
- Scan integrity of all protected system files
  - ~sfc /scannow~
** ~chkdsk~
- Checks the disk
- ~chkdsk /f~ fixes logical file system errors on disk
- ~chkdsk /r~ locates bad sectors, recovers readable information
  - implies ~/f~
** ~diskpart~
- Tool to manage disk configurations and partitions
  - ~diskpart~ starts the program, ~?~ to see commands
** ~tasklist~ and ~taskkill~
- Command line version of Task Manager
- Terminate tasks by PID (Process ID) or image name (IM)
  - ~taskkill /im skypeapp.exe~
  - ~taskkill /pid 7934 /t~ terminates app and its children
** Managing group policy from the command line
- managing Active Directory from the Command prompt
*** ~gpupdate~ force a group policy update
- ~gpupdate /target:nick /force~ reapplies all policy settings
*** ~gpresult~ 
- displays the Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) information for a target user and computer.
- ~gpresult /r~ does that
** ~format~
- formats the selected disk
- can choose quick or full, file system, etc with switches
** ~copy~
- Copies files from one place to another
  - ~copy (/a, /v, /y)~
  - ~/v~ verifies that the copy occurred
  - ~/y~ [[color:red][dangerous!]] gets rid of the verification if you are about to overwrite an existing file
** ~xcopy~ verify policy settings for a user (or computer)
- Copies files /and/ directories
** ~robocopy~
- Designed as a better xcopy
  - Not a robot, but a "robust copy"

* 1.5 – Given a scenario, use Microsoft operating system features and tools.

** Administrative

*** Computer Management
- Microsoft Management Console (mmc.exe)
- You can tailor it with plug-ins to be your own personal dashboard and toolset
- Install snap-ins from /File/ menu
*** Device Manager
- This is where you manage devices and their drivers
- Can see and resolve many problems with peripherals here
- *Computer Management* or ~devmgmt.msc~
*** Local Users and Groups
- Default users on a machine are Administrator and User

*** Services
- Everything, mostly, is a service
- Every background process
- Sometimes those things running in the background cause problems
  - turn things on and off with ~net stop~ and ~net start~
*** System Configuration
- ~msconfig~ using Run
- or from Start menu in Windows 10
- can set system startups, look at statistics, plan a limited startup for troubleshooting
*** Task Scheduler
- Have different applications run and do things at different times
  - i.e. disk defragmentation, backups, I used to have it print out my time sheet every Thursday so I didn't forget
- Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Task Scheduler
- Equivalents in Linux or macOS: ~cron~ or ~launchctl~ (in macOS)

*** Component Services
- Microsoft COM+
  - Component Object Model

* 1.7 – Summarize application installation and configuration concepts.
- Many of these might appear obvious, but it is important to think about this systematically
- Not every computer can run every application
  - Some checking is simple
** System requirements

*** System Requirements - Drive space
- Initial installation requirement
- Some applications use significant space /after/ installation
*** System Requirements - RAM
- Applications may require RAM resources over and above what the operating system requires
- Total amount of RAM being used by *all* applications
  - Task Manager in Windows; Activity Monitor in macOS

** OS requirements

- Compatibility: Operating system
  - Windows, Linux, macOS
  - The version of the OS can be important

** Methods of installation and deployment

*** Local Installation (CD/USB)
- Most devices can have applications installed this way
- CD-ROM, DVD, USB drive, External hard drive
*** Network-based
- Standard in most large organizations
- Applications staged and deployed from central server
- Installations and updates handled centrally

** Local user permissions
- For a home user, not as important a consideration, though privileges may have to be escalated
- In an enterprise situation, more of an issue
*** Folder/file access for installation
- Application installation will involve the copying of large numbers of files
  - At times, to sensitive places in the system
  - User may need to run as Administrator / Root to install
  - This needs to be carefully limited
** Security considerations
- Applications can have adverse effects on the local machine or on the wider network
  - Applications have the same rights and privileges as the user
  - Applications can come from unknown / suspect sources
*** Application's impact to device
- Slowdowns, competition for resources
*** Application's effect on network
- Access to internal servers
- Rights and permissions to network shares

*** QoS
- Quality of Service - configure priority of services on the network
*** BIOS (on-board NIC)
- When the network connection device is built into the motherboard, some things are configured in the BIOS

* 1.9 – Given a scenario, use features and tools of the Mac OS and Linux client/desktop operating systems.

** Best practices

*** Scheduled backups
- Should be routine and scheduled
*** Scheduled disk maintenance
- In macOS, through Disk Utility App
  - Permissions can be verified
  - These can become corrupted over long use
*** System updates/App Store
 - In Linux done on command line
   - Ubuntu: ~sudo apt-get update~
   - Red Hat / CentOS: ~yum update~
   - Linux desktops have GUI apps for this
*** Patch management
- macOS - done through App Store
- Linux - through above update system
*** Driver/firmware updates
- as in last slide
*** Antivirus/Anti-malware updates
- Although macOS and Linux tend to have fewer security problems, people do sometimes install antivirus / antimalware

** Tools

*** Backup/Time Machine
- macOS utility for regular backups

** Features

*** Multiple desktops/Mission Control
*** Key Chain
- password management
*** Spot Light
- maintains directory of apps
*** iCloud
- Apple's cloud storage
*** Gestures
- Cool things you can do on your trackpad
- Configured in System PReferences / Trackpad
*** Finder
- macOS version of Windows File Explorer
*** Dock
- Bar with application shortcuts, usually on the bottom
  - But can be moved
*** Boot Camp
- Allows the boot of different operating systems

** Basic Linux commands

*** ~man~ 
- in most Linux / Unix distributions, this gives you the manual for a function
- format: ~man [command]~
  - just like ~help~ in Windows Command line
*** ~ls~
- listing of files in directory
- Like ~dir~ in Windows command line
*** ~grep~
- macOS / Linux search operator
  - can be complex or simple
*** ~cd~
- Change directory
- Just like in Windows CLI!
*** ~shutdown~
- As it says
- With different operators:
  - i.e. ~shutdown -r~ restarts the machine
*** ~pwd~ vs. ~passwd~
- People get very confused about this, understandably!
  - ~passwd~ changes your password
  - ~pwd~ gives you the "present working directory"
    - Tells you where you are in the filesystem
*** ~mv~
- moves a file, renames a file if it stays in the same directory
*** ~cp~
- copy: source and destination can be specified.  
*** ~rm~
- delete or remove files
*** ~chmod~
- Linux / macOS only (no equivalent in Windows)
- Changes the *mode* of files - permissions
*** ~chown~
- Change ownership of file / directory
*** ~iwconfig/ifconfig~
- Network configuration commands 
  - Like ~ipconfig~ on Windows
  - ~iwconfig~ is the wireless configuration, ~ifconfig~ is the wired configuration (InterFace CONFIGuration)
*** ~ps~
- "Process status" - displays running commands and processes, identifies them by their Process ID (PID)
*** ~su~ / ~sudo~
- Permits a *su* bstitute user to "do" a command
- ~sudo~ user is the "super user" 
  - analogous to "elevated privilege" in Windows
*** ~apt-get~
- In some versions of Linux used to retrieve, install, remove packages
*** ~vi~
- Simple text editor (I prefer ~nano~)
- I make fun of Vi, but it is so tiny and it is always there, no matter what weird little Linux distribution you are in
- So maybe, probably worth learning (but not for the A+!)

  - Used to back up data over network, or to drives, CDs, etc
  - Very powerful, can back up entire (and large) drives
*** ~kill~
- Halts a program or process

* 2.1 – Summarize the importance of physical security measures.

** Mantrap
- Area of controlled access between two secured areas
- Small room with two doors, for example
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.75\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75%
#+CAPTION: Physical security - mantrap
[[./images2/2-1-mantrap.png]]
** Badge reader
- Access is provided through security badges that contain coded data that identifies users to the security system.
** Smart card
- Smart cards are another way to deliver security tokens to the system. 
- Can both send and receive data, allowing the card and the card reader to verify each other
** Security guard
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.35\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 30%
#+CAPTION: Some kind of guard
[[./images2/2-1-SecurityGurad.png]]
- Can be effective
** Door lock
- Locking doors seem like a simple task, but it can be complicated!
  - Keys can be copied if left unattended
  - Locks can be picked granting unauthorized access
** Biometric locks
 - Using a person’s unique personal attributes such as their Iris, Fingerprint, or Voice to authenticate is known as *biometrics*
** Hardware tokens
- Tokens are a security component necessary for devices to communicate and provide the holder of the token the appropriate access level.
- Card reader, magnetic stripe, etc
** Cable locks
- Cable locks are used to secure valuable items, that can easily be removed from the workplace. 
** Server locks 
- To prevent unauthorized users from opening a server case
** USB locks
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.55\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
#+CAPTION: USB lock
[[./images2/2-1-USBlock.png]]
- These can prevent unauthorized use of a USB port
  - As you may recall, USB ports can be used to boot an outside operating system and can compromise the security of the OS.
** Privacy screen
- Privacy filters are employed by users who work in close proximity to others and require security from "shoulder surfing" 
- Reduces viewing angle of monitor

* 2.2 – Explain logical security concepts.

** Active Directory
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.75\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
#+CAPTION: Active Directory diagram of effective field
[[./images2/2-2-ActiveDirectory.png]]
 - Not really a single service anymore 
   - Now describes broad range of services and related databases for identity-related services
*** Login script
- When a user logs in, a list of commands are executed
  - Batch files, PowerShell scripts, etc that set up the user's identity in the organization's IT infrastructure
  - i.e. access to network shares, servers, email, etc
*** Domain
- The Active Directory organizational hierarchy
  - Often under single internet domain, i.e. Pepsi.com, GMU.edu, Healthcare.gov, etc
  - But can encompass more sites
*** Organizational Units
- *OU* - can contain one or more user groups
  - Allows the simplification of the hierarchy of user roles within the network infrastructure
*** Group Policy/Updates
- Domain resources (workstations, user profiles, privileges,etc
- These are controlled by the group policies of the Organizational Unit
*** Home Folder
- A regular home user (such as yourself) saves files locally to their home folder (i.e. ~C:\Users\[yourname]\Documents~)
  - In an enterprise setup, user's *home folders* can be on a network share, and thus available to the user wherever they go in the organization
*** Folder redirection
- The process in which Active Directory changes the users *home folder* from their workstation to a network share
- This simplifies management and backup requirements
  - Don't have to make a trip out to the user's computer to back up their files

** Software tokens
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.7\textwidth :placement [H]
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 30%
#+CAPTION: Software token on a smartphone
[[./images2/2-2-SoftwareToken.png]]
- Generated security component used for authentication
  - Devices synchronized with server
  - Can be cards, or software on phones / mobile devices
** MDM policies - BYOD vs corporate owned
- Mobile Device Management:
  - Corporate policy that manages personally-owned vs corporate-owned devices
  - Organization may require the installation of security apps in employee's phone under a BYOD (Bring Yoour Own Device) protocol
** Port security
- Used on switches and routers when connected devices communicate with each other over the network
** MAC address filtering
- Using a device's MAC address to permit or deny access
  - Remember this is not foolproof!  MAC addresses can be changed and spoofed
** Certificates
- Digital certificates serve to authorize users and servers
- Valid Certificate Authority is what guarantees encryption in ~https~ protocol and gives you that nice padlock at the top of your browser
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.75\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 0%
#+CAPTION: encryption verification
[[./images2/2-2-httpsLockPepsiDotCom.png]]
** Antivirus/Anti-malware
- Especially in an enterprise context, this kind of security is paramount
  - These programs will examine behavior and content of files against known threats
  - Virus and malware definitions must be updated on a regular basis
  - Best done centrally, like other software updates
** Firewalls - hardware vs software
- Barrier between the dangerous outside network and the LAN / individual computers
- *Hardware firewall* - often found as a part of routers
  - Filters all traffic allowed onto network
  - Hardware firewall only inspects inbound traffic
- *Software firewall* - on individual workstations, usually, such as Windows Defender Firewall
** User authentication/strong passwords
- The first line of security on a network or device
  - Best "strong" passwords made by password generators
    - COMPTIA still recommends those kinds of "strong" passwords with different character types, upper-case, lower-case, etc: ~e5wd#*Ljp2B9G7!y~ for example
    - But, here's a good comic:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 99%
#+CAPTION: An instructive xkcd comic 
[[./images2/2-2-xkcdPasswordStrip.png]]
** Multifactor authentication
- Strong password along with another form of identification / knowledge is superior to a password alone
  - Mantra of multifactor identification:
    - something you know, something you have, something you are, something you do
** Directory permissions
- In both Linux and Windows, permissions and rights can be determined at the levels of individual directories and files
  - Can prevent accidental / unauthorized deletion or modification
  - *NTFS* - Windows file system format
    - very granular levels of permissions, bu not always obvious to user
** VPN
 - *Virtual Private Network* Communicating securely over an insecure pathway
 - Secure, encrypted tunnel between remote users and the private network of a corporation, enterprise, or home
** DLP
- *Data Loss Prevention* - software and hardware mechanisms to check emails going in and out
- It is about data /security/ not backing up data
** Access control lists
- A database of users and devices that are explicitly allowed to access certain networks or devices
- Can be filtered by: users, IP addresses, port numbers
- Some organizations ban entire /regions/ from accessing their network
** Email filtering
- To reduce spam and unwanted emails
- Can scan and block malicious code in emails, phishing, etc
- Often done by your email service, whether it is Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, or even AOL (\sad)
- Organizations will have their own protocols on top of this
** Trusted/untrusted software sources
- From *trusted* purveyors / producers of software
  - These will often be digitally signed
- *Untrusted* from links in spam email, suspicious third-party applications, etc
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.99\textwidth :placement [H]
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
#+CAPTION: totally not a suspicious program.exe
[[./images2/2-2-suspiciousProgram.png]]
** Principle of least privilege
- User's privileges should be kept to the lowest level required to perform their duties
- These minimal privileges can be elevated only when absolutely necessary
  - This is why you go through an extra step to get Administrator / Root privileges even on your home computer
  - In an enterprise context, you *will not* have those privileges and you will have to ask for them
    - (unless your work for the IT department, of course!)

* 2.3 Compare and contrast wireless security protocols and authentication methods.

** Protocols and Encryption
- Any wireless protocol transmits data over the air
  - And it can thus be intercepted
  - The answer is encryption
*** WEP
- Wired Equivalent Privacy
- By 2002, serious flaws had been found in this protocol
  - Key is static and does not change
- [[color:red][_Do not use!!_]]
*** WPA
- Wi-Fi Protected Access
- Temporary successor to WEP
  - Keys constantly changing
  - Used RC4 (or ARC4) simple cipher now shown to be insecure
*** TKIP
- Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
  - Frequently changing 64-bit authentication keys
  - Now shown to be somewhat vulnerable
*** WPA2
- Currently the *best* wireless protection protocol available
  - Uses AES (below) and CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol)
*** AES
- Advanced Encryption Standard
  - 128-bit key
  - Improves method first used in TKIP
*** Summary
- Best encryption standard is WPA2 with AES

** Authentication
*** Wireless security modes
 - Open - no security
 - WPA2 Personal / WPA2-PSK
   - WPA2 with a Pre-Shared Key
 - WPA2-Enterprise
   - Additional authentication - RADIUS or TACAS (below)
*** Single-factor
- Simplest form of authentication
  - PIN or password
  - Or One Time Passwords (OTP)
*** Multifactor
- Two or more independent authentication methods
*** RADIUS
- Remote Access Dial-in User Service
  - Centralized authentication
  - Every user has their own identity and password
  - No password to share
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.75\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95%
#+CAPTION: RADIUS authentication
[[./images2/2-3-RADIUS.png]]
*** TACACS
- Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System
  - Remote authentication protocol
  - Newer version is TACACS+

* 2.4 Given a scenario, detect, remove, and prevent malware using appropriate tools and methods.

** Malware
- Portmanteau of "malicious software"
  - Any software designed to cause damage to a computer, server, or network
*** Ransomware
- Malefactors damage your computer / network and promise to undo the damage for money
  - Often network drives will be encrypted by the malware, and after payment the encryption key will be given
*** WannaCry 2017
 - Global ransomware attack, hit the UK NHS particularly hard
   - [[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/12/nhs-ransomware-cyber-attack-what-is-wanacrypt0r-20][Link to Guardian story]]
   - Many hospitals / clinics in the UK were still running Windows XP and unpatched Windows 7 machines
   - You don't need to know about this for the A+ but it's a good story!
*** Trojan
- Infected versions of legitimate-looking software
  - Some can disable antivirus, System Restore
*** Keylogger 
- Program sneaks in to monitor and send out your keystrokes
  - Passwords, credit card numbers, everything you type
  - Sends it out in the clear, circumvents encryption
  - often part of trojans
*** Rootkit
  - Name comes from Unix superuser - root
  - Modifies core system files (kernel)
  - Dastardly and invisible
  - Works as root, has complete control
    - Only defense is prevention - once infected, it is too late!
*** Virus
- Infect the system and replicate themselves
  - Usually transmitted through executable files
  - Can be harmless or extremely damaging
  - Importance of regular security updates
  - Can lead to telling slowness of computer, increased network activity
*** Botnet
- Groups of computers / devices taken over by viruses / trojans
  - Then used to infect more machines, run DDOS attacks, or do whatever
*** Worm
- Self-replicating malicious software
  - unlike viruses, need no human interaction to spread
    - Uses networks as medium of transmission
    - Often worse and harder to control than viruses
*** Spyware
- Malware designed to spy on you in various ways
  - Monitors your activity, sends the information back
  - Can include keylogging

** Tools and methods

*** Antivirus
- Keep it updated and running
*** Anti-malware
- Can work together with antivirus
- [[https://www.malwarebytes.com/][Malwarebytes]] probably the best known
*** Recovery console
- In Windows 10, Recovery Environment (RE) replaced the recovery console
  - Powerful and dangerous, a last resort
  - Can repair many things including the Master Boot Record (MBR)

*** Backup/restore
- Service first became available with Windows 7
  - Still in Windows 8.1 and 10
*** End user education
- Often the most important part of prevention
  - Don't click on things!
  - Don't open that weird email!
  - Oh, but they just keep on doing it. 
*** Secure DNS
- Offered by external services, but can also set up yourself
  - Cloudflare, for example
  - Can block harmful websites based on lists
  - [[https://pi-hole.net/][Pi-hole]] is a good example of a selfhosted type (will not be on exam!)

* 2.5 Compare and contrast social engineering, threats, and vulnerabilities.

** Social Engineering
- Can be difficult to predict and protect against
- Changing and adapting methods
  - All human weaknesses can be exploited
  - Gaining inappropriate levels of trust
*** Some common angles
 - Urgency
 - Appearance of legitimacy
   - We make easy assumptions - uniforms, ID cards
 - Intimidation
 - Scarcity
 - False familiarity
*** Phishing
- Usually delivered by email or messaging system
  - Usually with malicious link
  - Could be Facebook, Instagram, etc
  - Message contains a malicious link
  - At first glance will look legitimate
*** Spear phishing
 - Phishing with inside information
 - Use of familiar emails, formats
 - Spear phishing the CEO called "whaling"
   - Again, false legitimacy 
*** Dumpster diving
- Going through the garbage
- Usually not illegal to do
- Importance of data destruction
  - Shredding, destroying media
*** Impersonation
 - Appeals to authority
 - The more keys you have, the more authoritative you appear
*** Shoulder surfing
 - Insecure access to screen by others
   - Mobility makes us more vulnerable
   - We might not be aware we are targets
*** Tailgating
 - Using others to gain access to restricted areas
 - Most security is at the borders
** DDoS
 - Distributed Denial of Service
 - An army of computers mobilized to overwhelm a service
 - Large botnets can be millions of computers
** Mitigation of DDOS
- Identifying patterns
- High grade firewall
- ISP may have mitigation strategies
- Again, Cloudflare has made this their business
** Zero-day
- An exploitation of an OS / application weakness that has not previously been reported
** Man-in-the-middle
 - Uses a webserver in-between user and destination
 - Redirects traffic
 - VPN makes you more secure

[[./images2/2-5-ManInTheMiddle.png]]
** Brute force
- Guessing passwords over and over
- Sometimes sophisticated methods, sometimes not
** Dictionary
- Checking all words in dictionary one-by-one
** Rainbow table
 - Pre-built series of hashes
 - Calculations have been done for you already
 - "Salted" hashes less vulnerable to this
   - additional values added to hash
** Spoofing
 - Pretending to be something you are not
 - Can spoof emails, MAC addresses, phone numbers
** Non-compliant systems
- Systems that are not regularly updated or patched,
* 3.1 – Given a scenario, use the best practice methodology to resolve problems.

** Always consider corporate policies, procedures, and impacts before implementing changes
** 1. Identify the problem
- Question the user and identify user changes to computer and perform backups before making
 changes
- Inquire regarding environmental or infrastructure changes 
- Review system and application logs

** 2. Establish a theory of probable cause (question the obvious)

 - If necessary, conduct external or internal research based on symptoms

** 3. Test the theory to determine cause

- Once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve problem
- If theory is not confirmed, establish new theory or escalate

** 4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution
- Build the plan
  - Calculate and document impact of solution
  - Backup / backout if things go bad
- Fix it!
** 5. Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures
- Restart the machine
- Confirm the fix
- Discuss with user
** 6. Document findings, actions, and outcomes
- Contribute to knowledge base
- Useful if problem occurs again
- In a legal sense, didn't happen until you document it
