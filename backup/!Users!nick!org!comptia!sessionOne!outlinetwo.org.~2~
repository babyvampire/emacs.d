* CompTIA A+ 2002

Just as in the 1001, the 1002 has partcular components that are covered.  Here is the breakdown:

| Domain | Substance                | percent |
|--------+--------------------------+---------|
|      1 | Operating Systems        |     27% |
|      2 | Security                 |     24% |
|      3 | Software Troubleshooting |     26% |
|      4 | Operational Procedures   |     23% |
|--------+--------------------------+---------|

* 1.1 – Compare and contrast common operating system types and their purposes.
** What is an OS and why do you need one?
- Interaction between components of machine
  - Many 1s and 0s are passed between the CPU, RAM, keyboard, video and sound cards
  - Someone needs to manage this at a higher level so that the user can participate
- Common platform for applications to work on / together
- Also provides bridge between humans and computer 
** Standard OS features
- File management
- Application support
- Input / output support
  - Printers, keyboards, hard drives, USB
  - It's sort of like a higher-level BIOS, right?
** 32-bit vs. 64-bit
- Pretty much all PCs being produced today are 64-bit
- But you will see 32-bit machines in the field
  - You may see 16-bit machines, but probably only museum pieces
  - First 32-bit CPU in 1985: Intel 386DX
*** RAM limitations
- 32-bit CPUs are limited to 4 GB of RAM
- 64-bit CPUs have a default maximum of 256 TB and could be extended to 4 petabytes (PB)
  - (though no one would do that, yet)
  - RAM is limited by the operating system:
    - Windows 7 64-bit can go to 192 GB
    - Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit can handle up to 512 GB
    - Windows 10 Pro 64-bit can handle up to 2 TB
*** Software Compatibility
- Most editions of Windows are still available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions
  - There are 32-bit and 64-bit versions of most major Linux distributions as well
  - The most recent macOS (Catalina) is 64-bit only, and will not run 32-bit programs
  - Whereas 64-bit Windows can still run 32-bit programs
*** Where Windows keeps it
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- 64-bit system files and apps are in ~C:\Windows\System32~
- 32-bit system files and apps are in ~C:\Windows\SysWOW64~
  - Yes, this makes very little sense
  - Based in the development of Windows from 32-bit to 64-bit
*** Slightly confusing code:
- x86 = 32-bit
- x64 = 64-bit (and often called AMD64)
  
** Workstation operating systems
- By "workstation," CompTIA means a desktop or laptop that someone sits at and does work
- So we are not including further discussion of servers for the rest of this course
*** Microsoft Windows

#+ATTR_HTML: :style float:left; margin:75px ; width: 100px;
[[/Users/nick/org/comptia/sessionOne/images2/1-1-windows10.png]]
- By far the most common
- Different versions: 
  - You will be expected to know 7, 8, 8.1, and 10
  - There are others that you will not have to know, such as Windows Server
- Advantages and disadvantages:
  - Good - big presence means big support
    - Lots of different kinds of software
  - Bad - Large target for security exploitation
    - So much different hardware, so many versions still running
*** Apple Macintosh OS
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.2\textwidth :placement [H]
#+ATTR_HTML: :style float:left; margin:50px ; width: 100px; 
[[/Users/nick/org/comptia/sessionOne/images2/1-1-apple-emblem.jpg]]
- Advantages:
  - easy to use
  - always compatible
  - few security concerns
  - free with Apple hardware

\FloatBarrier
#+REVEAL: split
- Disadvantages:

- Companies set their own EOLs, they vary by software package
*** Update limitations
- iOS, Android, and Windows 10 check for updates and prompt to update
- ChromeOS updates automatically
- Linux you gotta do it yourself
** Compatibility concerns between operating systems
- Applications designed for one OS generally cannot run on a different OS

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 99%
[[/Users/nick/org/comptia/sessionOne/images2/1-2-windows10.png]]
** Corporate vs. personal needs
- Many aspects of Windows designed for "the enterprise"
*** Domain access
- Using Active Directory Domain Services
  - People in the know talk about AD as being the best piece  of software Microsoft ever produced
  - Can keep track of accounts and users across the entire enterprise
  - Distributed architecture
*** Domain Access cont'd
- Many different uses:
  - Authentication
  - Centralized management
  - SSO (single sign-on), the holy grail of domain management
*** BitLocker
- BitLocker is Full Disk Encryption (FDE)
- Every single thing is encrypted
*** EFS
- Encrypting File System

- Reduces bandwidth use over long distances

** Desktop styles/user interface
- Flexibility and personalization of desktop limited at work
- Much more flexible in home editions without the central control

* 1.3 – Summarize general OS installation considerations and upgrade methods.

** Boot methods
- Operating systems can be installed from different media
*** USB
- USB needs to be bootable
- Computer needs to support booting from USB
*** CD-ROM
- You don't see it quite as much any more, but used to be the standard way
*** DVD
- See this a little more because it can hold more data
- But, especially in laptops, see fewer DVD drives
*** PXE
- "pixie"
- Preboot eXecution Environment
- perform a remote network installation
*** Solid state/flash drives
- Another possible media
*** NetBoot
- Apple technology for booting  Macs from network
- Similar to PXE
*** External/hot-swappable drive
- External CD-ROM / DVD
*** Internal hard drive (partition)
- Can install and boot from separate drive
- Can mount an .iso
** Type of installations

*** Unattended installation
- Can set up answers to Windows questions in a file
- So that there are no interruptions
*** In-place upgrade
- Maintain existing applications and data
*** Clean install
- Wipe eveything and reinstall 
*** Repair installation
- Fixes problems with the Windows OS
  - Doesnot touch user files
*** Multiboot
- Running two ormore operating systems from the same computer
*** Remote network installation
*** Image deployment
- Easier way to do mass installations
- Deploy a clone on every computer
*** Recovery partition
- A hidden partition with recovery files
*** Refresh/restore
- Windows 8/10 feature to clean things up
- Requires a recovery partition

** Partitioning
- An ancient concept
  - Separates physical drive into logical pieces
  - Can keep data, operating systems distinct
- Formatted partitions are called volumes
  - (Microsoft terminology)
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.75\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 30%
#+CAPTION: A diagram of partitioning concepts
[[/Users/nick/org/comptia/sessionOne/images2/1-3-partitioning.png]]
*** MBR
- Master Boot Record
  - one of the earliest ways of doing this
  - lots of limitations
*** Primary
- in MBR partitions;
  - a bootable partition
  - Maximum of four primary partitions per disk
*** Extended
- Extends the maximum number of partitions
*** GPT
- GUID Partition Table
  - The newest partition standard
  - Globally unique identifier
- Requires UEFI BIOS
  - Can have up to 128 primary partitions
  - Does not require extended partitions or any sneaky stuff to extend it


** File system types/formatting
- Before data can be written to the partition, it must be formatted
- Operating systems expect a particular format
  - FAT32 and NTFS currently most popular
    - but ext3 and ext4 coming up behind fast
*** FAT
- File Allocation Table
- Earliest; (1980ish)
*** FAT32
- Larger (2 TB file sizes)
- maximum file size of 4 GB
*** ExFAT
- Extended File Allocation Table
- Microsoft flash drive file system
- Files can be larger than 4 GB
*** NTFS
- NTFS - NT File System
  - Extensive improvements over FAT32
  - Quotas, file compression, encryption, symbolic links
*** CDFS
- Compact Disk File System
- All operating systems can read the CD
*** NFS
- Network File System
- Access files across the network as if they were local
*** ext3, ext4
- Third extended file system
- Fourth extended file system
- Generally on Linux systems
*** HFS
- HFS+ - Mac OS Extended
*** Swap partition
- CPU temporarily uses part of a hard drive when it runs out of RAM
  - Frees RAM by moving data to disk
  - Has to be a very fast magnetic drive or an SSD
*** Quick format vs. full format
- Quick:
  - Creates new file table
  - Data *appears* to be erased but it is not
    - Quick format in Windows 7, 8, 10
      - use ~diskpart~ for full format
*** Full format
- Writes zeroes to the entire disk
- You data is unrecoverable
** Load alternate third-party drivers when necessary
- Sometimes your devices will not have drivers built into the OS
- Then will need to get them from the manufacturer
** Workgroup vs. Domain setup
- Workgroups vs domains:
  - *Domain* a group of computers that share a common user account database.  Users can log in to access shared resources
  - *Workgroup* a simpler concept, a group of computers that share resources such as printers and files.  But each computer keeps track of its own user accounts, no centralized management.
- At home: workgroup
- At work: domain
** Time/date/region/language settings
- Basic settings that we sometimes forget!
** Driver installation, software, and Windows updates
- Before you can say that you are finished installing an operating system:
  - Load video drivers, install apps, update OS
** Factory recovery partition
- A hidden partition that will allow you to reset your operating system to its original state
- Could be useful later; but this is not as useful a feature as it used to be
- The problem is that it erases everything and starts over
** Properly formatted boot drive with the correct partitions/format
- Make sure you know the partitions that are there
- Is there old data on there?
- Backup the data you need
  - Always backup before you do anything big!
** Prerequisites/hardware compatibility
- Before installation make sure you meet minimum OS requirements
  - Memory, disk space, etc.
- Run a hardware compatibility checker
  - i.e. Windows 10 Upgrade Checker
** Application compatibility
- Make sure your apps will still work after the upgrade
  - Need to check with manufacturer
  - 32-bit vs 64-bit etc (especially with macOS)
** OS compatibility/upgrade path
- Different upgrade paths for different versions of Windows
#+REVEAL: split
** Windows 8 upgrade path
- [[color:green][*Upgrade*]] = can perform in-place upgrade
- [[color:red][*Install*]] = must do clean install
