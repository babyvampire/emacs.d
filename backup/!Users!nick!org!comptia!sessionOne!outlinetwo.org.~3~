* CompTIA A+ 1002

Just as in the 1001, the 1002 has partcular components that are covered.  Here is the breakdown:

| Domain | Substance                | percent |
|--------+--------------------------+---------|
|      1 | Operating Systems        |     27% |
|      2 | Security                 |     24% |
|      3 | Software Troubleshooting |     26% |
|      4 | Operational Procedures   |     23% |
|--------+--------------------------+---------|

* 1.1 – Compare and contrast common operating system types and their purposes.
** What is an OS and why do you need one?
- Interaction between components of machine
  - Many 1s and 0s are passed between the CPU, RAM, keyboard, video and sound cards
  - Someone needs to manage this at a higher level so that the user can participate
- Common platform for applications to work on / together
- Also provides bridge between humans and computer 
** Standard OS features
- File management
- Application support
- Input / output support
  - Printers, keyboards, hard drives, USB
  - It's sort of like a higher-level BIOS, right?
** 32-bit vs. 64-bit
- Pretty much all PCs being produced today are 64-bit
- But you will see 32-bit machines in the field
  - You may see 16-bit machines, but probably only museum pieces
  - First 32-bit CPU in 1985: Intel 386DX
*** RAM limitations
- 32-bit CPUs are limited to 4 GB of RAM
- 64-bit CPUs have a default maximum of 256 TB and could be extended to 4 petabytes (PB)
  - (though no one would do that, yet)
  - RAM is limited by the operating system:
    - Windows 7 64-bit can go to 192 GB
    - Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit can handle up to 512 GB
    - Windows 10 Pro 64-bit can handle up to 2 TB
*** Software Compatibility
- Most editions of Windows are still available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions
  - There are 32-bit and 64-bit versions of most major Linux distributions as well
  - The most recent macOS (Catalina) is 64-bit only, and will not run 32-bit programs
  - Whereas 64-bit Windows can still run 32-bit programs
*** Where Windows keeps it
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- 64-bit system files and apps are in ~C:\Windows\System32~
- 32-bit system files and apps are in ~C:\Windows\SysWOW64~
  - Yes, this makes very little sense
  - Based in the development of Windows from 32-bit to 64-bit
*** Slightly confusing code:
- x86 = 32-bit
- x64 = 64-bit (and often called AMD64)
  
** Workstation operating systems
- By "workstation," CompTIA means a desktop or laptop that someone sits at and does work
- So we are not including further discussion of servers for the rest of this course
*** Microsoft Windows

[[/Users/nick/org/comptia/sessionOne/images2/1-1-windows10.png]]
- By far the most common
- Different versions: 
  - You will be expected to know 7, 8, 8.1, and 10
  - There are others that you will not have to know, such as Windows Server
- Advantages and disadvantages:
  - Good - big presence means big support
    - Lots of different kinds of software
  - Bad - Large target for security exploitation
    - So much different hardware, so many versions still running
*** Apple Macintosh OS

#+ATTR_HTML: :style float:left; margin:50px ; width: 100px; 
[[/Users/nick/org/comptia/sessionOne/images2/1-1-apple-emblem.jpg]]
- Advantages:
  - easy to use
  - always compatible
  - few security concerns
  - free with Apple hardware

#+REVEAL: split
- Disadvantages:
  - Requires Apple hardware
  - Less industry support

- Its relationship with Android can be confusing
- Google Chrome browser is essentially its own operating system, and Chrome OS is based on this

** Vendor-specific limitations

*** End-of-life
- EOL - when a company stops supporting a package
- Companies set their own EOLs, they vary by software package
*** Update limitations
- iOS, Android, and Windows 10 check for updates and prompt to update
- ChromeOS updates automatically
- Linux you gotta do it yourself
** Compatibility concerns between operating systems
- Applications designed for one OS generally cannot run on a different OS
- They must be specifically built to run on different OSs
- Many data files can work between operating systems: images, videos, sound files

* 1.2 – Compare and contrast features of Microsoft Windows versions.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 99%
[[/Users/nick/org/comptia/sessionOne/images2/1-2-windows10.png]]
** Corporate vs. personal needs
- Many aspects of Windows designed for "the enterprise"
*** Domain access
- Using Active Directory Domain Services
  - People in the know talk about AD as being the best piece  of software Microsoft ever produced
  - Can keep track of accounts and users across the entire enterprise
  - Distributed architecture
*** Domain Access cont'd
- Many different uses:
  - Authentication
  - Centralized management
  - SSO (single sign-on), the holy grail of domain management
*** BitLocker
- BitLocker is Full Disk Encryption (FDE)
- Every single thing is encrypted
*** EFS
- Encrypting File System
- Encrypt files one-by-one
*** Media center
- Video, music, and television portal
- Was discontinued; not available in Windows 10
- So people figure out how to put it back in
*** BranchCache
- Caching for branch offices
- Reduces bandwidth use over long distances

** Desktop styles/user interface
- Flexibility and personalization of desktop limited at work
- Much more flexible in home editions without the central control

* 1.3 – Summarize general OS installation considerations and upgrade methods.

** Boot methods
- Operating systems can be installed from different media
*** USB
- USB needs to be bootable
- Computer needs to support booting from USB
*** CD-ROM
- You don't see it quite as much any more, but used to be the standard way
*** DVD
- See this a little more because it can hold more data
- But, especially in laptops, see fewer DVD drives
*** PXE
- "pixie"
- Preboot eXecution Environment
- perform a remote network installation
*** Solid state/flash drives
- Another possible media
*** NetBoot
- Apple technology for booting  Macs from network
- Similar to PXE
*** External/hot-swappable drive
- External CD-ROM / DVD
*** Internal hard drive (partition)
- Can install and boot from separate drive
- Can mount an .iso
** Type of installations

*** Unattended installation
- Can set up answers to Windows questions in a file
- So that there are no interruptions
*** In-place upgrade
- Maintain existing applications and data
*** Clean install
- Wipe eveything and reinstall 
*** Repair installation
- Fixes problems with the Windows OS
  - Doesnot touch user files
*** Multiboot
- Running two ormore operating systems from the same computer
*** Remote network installation
*** Image deployment
- Easier way to do mass installations
- Deploy a clone on every computer
*** Recovery partition
- A hidden partition with recovery files
*** Refresh/restore
- Windows 8/10 feature to clean things up
- Requires a recovery partition

** Partitioning
- An ancient concept
  - Separates physical drive into logical pieces
  - Can keep data, operating systems distinct
- Formatted partitions are called volumes
  - (Microsoft terminology)
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.75\textwidth :placement [h] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 30%
#+CAPTION: A diagram of partitioning concepts
[[/Users/nick/org/comptia/sessionOne/images2/1-3-partitioning.png]]
*** MBR
- Master Boot Record
  - one of the earliest ways of doing this
  - lots of limitations
*** Primary
- in MBR partitions;
  - a bootable partition
  - Maximum of four primary partitions per disk
*** Extended
- Extends the maximum number of partitions
*** GPT
- GUID Partition Table
  - The newest partition standard
  - Globally unique identifier
- Requires UEFI BIOS
  - Can have up to 128 primary partitions
  - Does not require extended partitions or any sneaky stuff to extend it


** File system types/formatting
- Before data can be written to the partition, it must be formatted
- Operating systems expect a particular format
  - FAT32 and NTFS currently most popular
    - but ext3 and ext4 coming up behind fast
*** FAT
- File Allocation Table
- Earliest; (1980ish)
*** FAT32
- Larger (2 TB file sizes)
- maximum file size of 4 GB
*** ExFAT
- Extended File Allocation Table
- Microsoft flash drive file system
- Files can be larger than 4 GB
*** NTFS
- NTFS - NT File System
  - Extensive improvements over FAT32
  - Quotas, file compression, encryption, symbolic links
*** CDFS
- Compact Disk File System
- All operating systems can read the CD
*** NFS
- Network File System
- Access files across the network as if they were local
*** ext3, ext4
- Third extended file system
- Fourth extended file system
- Generally on Linux systems
*** HFS
- HFS+ - Mac OS Extended
*** Swap partition
- CPU temporarily uses part of a hard drive when it runs out of RAM
  - Frees RAM by moving data to disk
  - Has to be a very fast magnetic drive or an SSD
*** Quick format vs. full format
- Quick:
  - Creates new file table
  - Data *appears* to be erased but it is not
    - Quick format in Windows 7, 8, 10
      - use ~diskpart~ for full format
*** Full format
- Writes zeroes to the entire disk
- You data is unrecoverable
** Load alternate third-party drivers when necessary
- Sometimes your devices will not have drivers built into the OS
- Then will need to get them from the manufacturer
** Workgroup vs. Domain setup
- Workgroups vs domains:
  - *Domain* a group of computers that share a common user account database.  Users can log in to access shared resources
  - *Workgroup* a simpler concept, a group of computers that share resources such as printers and files.  But each computer keeps track of its own user accounts, no centralized management.
- At home: workgroup
- At work: domain
** Time/date/region/language settings
- Basic settings that we sometimes forget!
** Driver installation, software, and Windows updates
- Before you can say that you are finished installing an operating system:
  - Load video drivers, install apps, update OS
** Factory recovery partition
- A hidden partition that will allow you to reset your operating system to its original state
- Could be useful later; but this is not as useful a feature as it used to be
- The problem is that it erases everything and starts over
** Properly formatted boot drive with the correct partitions/format
- Make sure you know the partitions that are there
- Is there old data on there?
- Backup the data you need
  - Always backup before you do anything big!
** Prerequisites/hardware compatibility
- Before installation make sure you meet minimum OS requirements
  - Memory, disk space, etc.
- Run a hardware compatibility checker
  - i.e. Windows 10 Upgrade Checker
** Application compatibility
- Make sure your apps will still work after the upgrade
  - Need to check with manufacturer
  - 32-bit vs 64-bit etc (especially with macOS)
** OS compatibility/upgrade path
- Different upgrade paths for different versions of Windows
#+REVEAL: split
** Windows 8 upgrade path
- [[color:green][*Upgrade*]] = can perform in-place upgrade
- [[color:red][*Install*]] = must do clean install
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1.1\textwidth :placement [H] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 99%
#+CAPTION: Windows 8 upgrade path
[[/Users/nick/org/comptia/sessionOne/images2/1-3-windows8UpgradePath.png]]

* 1.4 – Given a scenario, use appropriate Microsoft command line tools.
** Command line
- Command line is where it is at
- Talking more directly to the computer
- When you get good at it, it can be faster and more rewarding than messing around in the GUI
- It is also more impressive to employers
- My prejudiced feeling is:
  - If you are serious about IT, you need to spend most of your time on the command line
** The Windows command line
- Microsoft calls this "the Command shell."
  - Windows really has two command shells: the Command shell and [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7][PowerShell]]
  - PowerShell resembles Command shell but is more for scripting and automation. 
    - You will not need to know PowerShell for the A+
** Command shell - the next generation
- There is a new version of Command shell, called Windows Terminal.  
  - It is open source and you can look at it [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7][here]]
  - People like me are happy because it has features of better  command lines and terminals in other operating systems
** Notes for this section
- Depending on the OS, the command line is called "the terminal" as well.
  - Things to be typed in the shell will look like this:
    - ~C:\>run COOLCOMMAND.EXE~
- Many commands have "switches" that change their actions:
  - e.g. ~chkdsk /f~ checks the disk and fixes system errors

Look cool using [[https://hackertyper.net/][hackertyper]]

** Privileges in the CLI
- Different users have different privileges, different commands they may run
  - In Windows, some commands can only be run by the Administrator
    - "elevated privileges"
    - Right-click on Command Prompt, choose /Run as Administrator/
      - or if you want to be really cool, <windows>+R ~cmd~ <ctrl> <shift> <enter>
    - In Linux / macOS this is called "root privilege"
** Help in the Command shell
- can type ~help [command]~
  - ~> help chkdsk~
- can also use ~[command] /?~
- end shell session with ~exit~
  
** Navigation
- In a GUI, the graphical representation of the operating system, we talk about "folders." 
  - In the command line, they are "directories"
*** ~dir~
 - Lists files and directories
*** ~cd~
- Changes directory:
  - ~cd documents~ will enter the "documents" folder
  - use ~\~ to specify folder names, volumes 
*** ~..~
- Two periods / dots
- Signifies the directory above the current directory
  - ~.~ signifies the current directory

** Network Command line tools
- ~ipconfig~
  - the starting command for figuring out network problems
  - tells you your [local] IP address, DNS server, DHCP server, gateway, etc
  - ~ipconfig /all~ gives you the verbose information

*** Network CLI tools:
- ~ping~
  - Tests if an IP address is reachable
  - Tells you how long the signal takes to get there
  - Uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol
    - A very old and fun tool
*** Network CLI tools:
- ~tracert~
  - Traces the path taken by a packet to a destination
  - Uses ICMP Time To Live Exceeded message in an interesting way:
    - time in TTL is in hops, not time
    - TTL=1 is the first router
    - TTL=2 is the 2nd router
    - Not all routers respond to ICMP
*** More tracert
- Linux and macOS allow you to specify the protocol, if ICMP is blocked or disregarded
- Though in Linux and Unix it is called ~traceroute~
- iOS sends UDP over port 33434
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.90\textwidth :placement [H] :float nil
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
#+CAPTION: Traceroute diagram
[[/Users/nick/org/comptia/sessionOne/images2/1-4-tracerouteDiagram.png]]
*** Network CLI tools:
- ~netstat~ shows network statistics for your local machine
- Seen in multiple OSs
  - ~netstat -a~ show all active connections
  - ~netstat -b~ displays the file using the port
  - ~netstat -n~ does not resolve names
*** Network CLI tools:
- ~nslookup~ Looks up information from DNS servers
  - Canonical names, IP addresses
*** Network CLI tools:
- ~net~
  - Windows network commands
    - See network resources:
      - ~net view \\<servername>~
      - ~net view /workgroup:<workgroupname>~
    - Map a network share to a drive letter:
      - ~net use h: \\<servername>\<sharename>~
    - See user account information:
      - ~net user <username>~

** ~shutdown~
- Shuts it down; with switches can change timing, restart it
  - ~shutdown /s /t nn~ wait nn seconds and shut down
  - ~shutdown /r /t nn~ shut down and restart after nn seconds
  - ~shutdown /a~ abort the shutdown
  - ~shutdown /m \\<computer>~ shuts down another computer
  - ~shutdown /c "<comment>"~ sends a message about why the computer is shutting down
    - (don't need to know that last one)
** ~dism~
- Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
  - manage and deploy Windows OS images
  - can automate this for deployment
** ~sfc~
- Scan integrity of all protected system files
  - ~sfc /scannow~
** ~chkdsk~

  - ~taskkill /im skypeapp.exe~
  - ~taskkill /pid 7934 /t~ terminates app and its children
** Managing group policy from the command line
- managing Active Directory from the Command prompt
*** ~gpupdate~ force a group policy update
- ~gpupdate /target:nick /force~ reapplies all policy settings
*** ~gpresult~ 
- displays the Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) information for a target user and computer.
- ~gpresult /r~ does that
** ~format~
- formats the selected disk
- can choose quick or full, file system, etc with switches
** ~copy~
- Copies files from one place to another
  - ~copy (/a, /v, /y)~
  - ~/v~ verifies that the copy occurred
  - ~/y~ [[color:red][dangerous!]] gets rid of the verification if you are about to overwrite an existing file
** ~xcopy~verify policy settings for a user (or computer)
- Copies files /and/ directories
** ~robocopy~
- Designed as a better xcopy
  - Not a robot, but a "robust copy"

* 1.5 – Given a scenario, use Microsoft operating system features and tools.

** Administrative

*** Computer Management
- Microsoft Management Console (mmc.exe)
- You can tailor it with plug-ins to be your own personal dashboard and toolset
- Install snap-ins from /File/ menu
*** Device Manager
- This is where you manage devices and their drivers
- Can see and resolve many problems with peripherals here
- *Computer Management* or ~devmgmt.msc~
*** Local Users and Groups
- Default users on a machine are Administrator and User
- You can add users
- Also "Guest" account
  - from a security standpoint, best to disable this
*** Local Security Policy
- In companies / large organizations usually managed through Active Directory
- Stand-alone computers need local policies
*** Performance Monitor
- Measurements of computer - speed, memory and CPU use
- Stores metrics
- Can be set to sound alarms if things go out of whack
*** Services

- Every background process
- Sometimes those things running in the background cause problems
  - turn things on and off with ~net stop~ and ~net start~
*** System Configuration
- ~msconfig~ using Run
- or from Start menu in Windows 10
- can set system startups, look at statistics, plan a limited startup for troubleshooting
*** Task Scheduler
- Have different applications run and do things at different times
  - i.e. disk defragmentation, backups, I used to have it print out my time sheet every Thursday so I didn't forget
- Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Task Scheduler
- Equivalents in Linux or macOS: ~cron~ or ~launchctl~ (in macOS)

*** Component Services
- Microsoft COM+
  - Component Object Model
  - Distributed applications designed for enterprise environments

  - /Selective Startup/ - choose applications to start
  - Useful for troubleshooting
*** Boot tab
- Control the boot location
- Parts of BIOS available in OS
*** Services tab
- Enable and disable Windows services
- Disable or reset services that might be causing problems
*** Startup tab
- Decide which programs start with OS boot
- Some turn out to be memory / CPU hogs
*** Tools tab

- Other things - system information, computer management, etc
- Centralized location for these tools

** Task Manager
- Lets you see what is happening in the moment
- /Ctrl-Alt-Del/ or /Ctrl-Shift-Esc/
*** Applications
